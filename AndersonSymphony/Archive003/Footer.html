		<p style="padding-left:10px;">Have you ever purchased <em>Anderson Symphony Orchestra</em> tickets, found yourself in the middle of a schedule change and then discovered you couldn't make the concert? Do we have an exciting option for you! It's called "ticket reciprocity" - a mutual exchange of privileges - which, in this case, involves four East Central Indiana Symphonies (including our own). If you find you can't use your <em>Anderson Symphony Orchestra</em> tickets but still want to enjoy a great symphony experience, you can contact any of our partners to exchange your unused <em>ASO</em> tickets for the best available seats at a regular season performance of their symphony.</p>
