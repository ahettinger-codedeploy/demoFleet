<b>Quality Meeting &amp; Performance Facilities</b><br><br>
The Clifton Center is an exquisitely restored 1930's performance and meeting complex 
located just east of downtown in the Clifton-Crescent Hill neighborhood. The Center 
is an anchor piece for the Frankfort Avenue historic business district, encouraging 
vitality and welcoming groups of people from across the Greater Louisville area.<br><br>
<img src="Webpage_files/cliftoncenter.jpg" alt="Clifton Center" align="left" border="0" height="90" width="120">
The Clifton Center is a nonprofit organization, governed by a 25-person 
board of 
community leaders. Its mission is to serve the Greater Louisville area 
with a quality 
facility for artistic productions, meetings and programs that will 
further an enriched 
sense of community. Operation of the Center is secured through earned 
income from rental 
fees and contributed income from our annual fund raising and 
community-building event, 
the Taste of Frankfort Avenue. A Capital Campaign Committee raises funds
 for restoration 
work which is more than halfway completed. A new elevator and east side 
lobby addition was completed in the summer of 2002.  Work continues with
 heating and air conditioning improvements for the second and third 
floor tenant spaces.<br><br>
<b>History</b><br><br>
For forty-five years the building served the families of St Frances of Rome parish as its 
elementary school. During that time, the auditorium was a cultural gathering place for the 
entire neighborhood. After the school closed in 1975, the building was home for Stage One: 
the Louisville Children's Theatre. In 1985, the facility became home for a school for 
special needs children. Over the years the auditorium was home to Trinity High School's 
drama program and other community theatre groups.<br><br>
In 1989, the parish and a few community leaders began to restore the theatre to its original 
splendor. In 1994, the Clifton Center was incorporated as a nonprofit organization to continue 
the renewal of the building and its role in the community. The Center has a long-term lease 
from the Archdiocese of Louisville to operate the building. In addition to its public role as 
the Clifton Center, the building continues to be used for educational programs and gathering 
space by the community of St. Frances of Rome, our neighbors and partners in the renovation of 
the facility.
