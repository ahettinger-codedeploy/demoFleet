            <P align=left>The <B>Maury County Arts Guild</B> is a non-profit 
            organization, which is open to everyone and anyone interested in the 
            Arts. We offer all areas of interest from theatre to crafts. The <A 
            href="http://www.artsguild.org/boardofdirectors.htm">Board of 
            Directors</A> is very open to new ideas and encourages membership 
            input.</P>
            <P align=left>For more than 30 years the <B>Maury County Arts 
            Guild</B> has been supporting and promoting arts within the 
            community and surrounding area. The<B> Arts Guild</B> was organized 
            in 1970 as a means for those interested to pool their cultural 
            resources and promote free expression of the arts in the community. 
            In April 1972, the <B>Arts Guild</B> adopted a constitution and 
            received it's first charter. The <B>Arts Guild</B> is affiliated 
            with the Tennessee Arts Commission.</P>
            <P align=left>Early activities of the <B>Arts Guild</B> included the 
            first Spring Arts Festival in 1971 which would evolve into the 
            <I>Annual Mule Day Arts &amp; Crafts Show</I>, still drawing bigger 
            crowds of people each year. </P>
            <P align=left>Since those early beginnings, the <B>Arts Guild 
            </B>has grown by leaps and bounds. Until 1985, the <B>Arts 
            Guild's</B> home was on West 7th Street, where many music and arts 
            shows such as <I>Wine, Women and Song</I> were annual events. But 
            the Guild's home was not built for theatre, so plays had to be 
            performed elsewhere in the community. </P>
            <P align=center><B><FONT color=#ffff00>The Original Arts Center on 
            West 7th Street</FONT></B> </P>
            <P align=center><IMG height=252 src="" width=319 border=0> </P>
            <P align=left>Thus a dream was born that a facility would be built 
            to incorporate an art gallery, classrooms,&nbsp; and performing 
            facilities as well as a business center for the <B>Arts Guild</B>. 
            Today that dream sits at 705 Lion Parkway, which had its Grand 
            Opening in August 1986. The <B>Arts Guild</B> now holds a 225 seat 
            performing arts wing, a kitchen, storage, two dressing rooms, a gift 
            shop, and additional restrooms. In 1991, the entrance and performing 
            arts wing were made wheelchair accessible.
