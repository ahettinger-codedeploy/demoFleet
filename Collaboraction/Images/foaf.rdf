MISSION

COLLABORACTION is a company of creative people organized as a non-profit corporation which serves as the hub of a large and fluid Chicago-based artistic community to create unique artistic 		experiences through theatre and multi-disciplinary collaboration in order to celebrate the human spirit.


VISION

Our vision is one of growth and evolution in entertainment, driven by a diverse collection of 
artists committed to creating and sharing unique, inspired, and energizing interactive theatrical 		experiences.  We take inspiration from theatre, music, film, visual art and dance.  We combine 		these mediums in unexpected and original ways.  


VALUES

We value the fundamentals of writing, directing, design, and acting which we inherited from the great Chicago theater tradition.  We also value ambitious, high-quality work that addresses the interests of our target audience in novel and entertaining ways.  We value the ideal of an inclusive artistic community, where both artist and audience are integral.  We value innovative marketing.  While we are artistically ambitious we have learned that true creativity can only be sustained by an organization which values fiscal responsibility and sound business planning.  Finally, we highly value our Brand Identity comprising of the following elements.
