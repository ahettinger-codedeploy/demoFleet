            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica">Appleton shares its history with 
            Lawrence University, for the two grew simultaneously. The close 
            relationship established in the early years continues to exist.</P>
            <P>Fur traders seeking to do business with Fox River Valley Indians 
            were the first settlers in Appleton. Hippolyte Grignon built the 
            White Heron in 1835 to house his family and serve as an inn and 
            trading post.</P>
            <P>With the financial backing of Amos Lawrence, the Lawrence 
            Institute was chartered in 1847. Samuel Appleton donated $10,000 to 
            the newly founded college library, and in appreciation, his name was 
            given to the community.</P>
            <P>Appleton was incorporated first as a village in 1853 (John F. 
            Johnston, the first resident, village president) and later as a city 
            in 1857 (Amos Storey, Mayor).</P>
            <P>Among the 36 individuals who have served as the city's chief 
            elected official, John Goodland, Jr. had the longest tenure, with 18 
            years in office. Dorothy Johnson, Appleton's first female mayor, was 
            elected in 1980 and served for 12 years. Timothy M. Hanna is the 
            current mayor.</P>
            <P>Education was, and continues to be, a priority in Appleton. In 
            1850, Daniel Huntley taught in the first free public school. The St. 
            Mary Catholic Church opened the first parochial school in the 
            community in 1864. The first 4 year high school began operating in 
            1876 in the Hercules School and Kindergarten was initiated in 1898 
            in Lincoln School. With population growth came the need for 
            additional facilities. Today there are 24 public and 13 parochial 
            schools.</P>
            <P>Lawrence University's 84 acre campus, with 32 instructional, 
            recreational and administrative buildings, 1200 students drawn from 
            45 states and 38 foreign countries, and a faculty of 114 men and 
            women, lies east of the city's attractive, lively downtown. Students 
            and faculty members supply the community with an endless array of 
            music, drama and sports activities.</P>
            <P>Appleton traditionally has had a commitment to vocational 
            education. The Vocational School was established in 1912, and the 
            first facility in the United States to be built exclusively for this 
            purpose was erected here in 1917. When the State of Wisconsin was 
            divided into vocational, technical and adult education districts in 
            1965, the local program was expanded and the Fox Valley Technical 
            College was established.</P>
            <P>Area business has been responsible for Appleton's economic 
            prosperity and progressive attitude. The paper industry, beginning 
            with the building of the first paper mill in the city in 1853, has 
            been at the forefront of the development of Appleton, In order to 
            provide electricity to this industry, the nation's first 
            hydro-electric central station began operation in Appleton on 
            September 30, 1882. Not too long afterward, in August of 1886, 
            Appleton was the site for another national first, the operation of a 
            commercially successful electric streetcar company. Electric lights 
            replaced gas lamps on College Avenue in 1912.</P>
            <P>Our community also made history when Alfred Galpin put together 
            his own telephone in 1877, connecting his bank and his residence. 
            Later, a druggist installed several phones in his store, linking 
            them with those in other offices. The Wisconsin Telephone Company 
            purchased this exchange in 1881.</P>
            <P>Retail trade has also contributed to the area's progress. Because 
            stores have always been concentrated on College Avenue, businessmen 
            actively cooperate with city government in downtown redevelopment. A 
            major convention center, the Paper Valley Hotel, was opened in 1982 
            and a shopping complex, The Avenue, commenced operations in March of 
            1987.</P>
            <P>From its beginnings in 1853 as the Appleton Crescent, now the 
            Appleton Post Crescent, the newspaper has provided coverage of the 
            political, educational and industrial arenas of the community.</P>
            <P>Cultural growth was encouraged early in Appleton. Central to that 
            development has been public library service. Beginning in a reading 
            room above a grocery store on College Avenue, the Appleton Public 
            Library has developed over the years. Today it is housed in a modern 
            2 story facility on North Oneida Street. It offers a 240,000 volume 
            book collection, audiovisual equipment and software rental, as well 
            as computer database searching. In 1986, the APL was designated 
            among the 50 outstanding libraries in the nation.</P>
            <P>The preservation of Appleton's history has been the work of the 
            Outagamie County Historical Society. Its museum contains artifacts 
            of Appleton's famous native son, escape artist Harry Houdini and 
            author Edna Ferber, who grew up in Appleton. The museum showcases 
            Appleton's heritage as a progressive, industrious community in 
            Wisconsin's Fox River Valley.</P>
            <P>The residents of our community are proud of Appleton's past and 
            present, and they manifest a great confidence in its future and a 
            dedication to its ongoing betterment.</FONT> </P></TD></TR>
