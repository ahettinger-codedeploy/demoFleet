Now, separate from National Theatre Live, we are thrilled to announce three brand new productions captured live including Ralph Fiennes and Vanessa Redgrave in the Almeida Theatre's new production of <strong>Richard III</strong>, the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company's new production of    <strong>Romeo and Juliet </strong>starring Lily James, Richard Madden and Derek Jacobi, and from the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford Upon Avon a unique celebration of the multidisciplinary influence the works of Shakespeare have had upon theatre, music, dance, and opera titled    <strong>Shakespeare Live! From The RSC</strong> hosted by David Tennant and Catherine Tate and featuring Judi Dench, Ian McKellan, Benedict Cumberbatch, Helen Mirren, John Lithgow, Rufus Wainwright, the Royal Ballet and many more!
