			<p>Dear [FirstName] [LastName]:</p>
			<p>National Theatre Live continues to bring both the best of London theatre to cinemas worldwide and bringing the hottest tickets in London to cinemas before they come to Broadway. Your Fall/Winter season subscription concludes with the thrilling new adaptation of <i>Treasure Island</i> topping off what has been one of the most diverse ever including thrilling revivals of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire, Of Mice and Men</i>, and <i>Skylight</i>.</p>
			<p>Now National Theatre Live returns for the Spring/Summer of 2015 with five new productions that further prove it is one of the most exciting and dynamic theatre companies on the planet. The season begins in March with David Hare's new play based on Katherine Boo's acclaimed book <b>Behind The Beautiful Forevers</b>. A tumultuous play on an epic scale that takes the audience beyond the luxury hotels which surround Mumbai's airport and into the lives of those who live there. Then National Theatre Live again brings a thrilling revival of an American classic from The New Vic to audiences worldwide as it presents Mark Strong starring in Arthur Miller's <b>A View From The Bridge</b>. Tom Stoppard returns to the National with his highly anticipated new play <b>The Hard Problem</b> directed by Nicholas Hytner. Ralph Fiennes plays Jack Tanner in an exhilarating reinvention of George Bernard Shaw's witty and provocative classic <b>Man and Superman</b>. In July Oscar-winner Chiwetel Ejiofor takes the title role in Carol Ann Duffy's dynamic new adaptation of one of the English drama's oldest plays <b>Everyman</b>.</p>
