Wait, what? Eleven different shows at eleven different sites? All within
 walking distance of each other?  In the heart of downtown Greenfield? 
Double Take Fringe Festival is coming on November 11 and 12, 2011 from 
6:30-10 pm, in venues around the city of Greenfield all within a stones'
 throw of one another and near restaurants and pubs. Along the model of 
Brick and Mortar Video Festival, Double Take will take over the downtown
 scene and present fringe theater pieces all about 30 minutes long over 
two days in a variety of buildings - some vacant, some restaurants, some
 alternative spaces. You will be entertained, amazed, and in awe of your
 community, as the performers all come from the Pioneer Valley.  This is
 the first annual event TICKETS AVAILABLE ONLINE OR AT THE CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE IN GREENFIELD, WORLD EYE BOOKS AND RAVEN BOOKS. SEATING IS 
FIRST COME FIRST SERVE SO COME EARLY. Ticket for both nights only $15.
