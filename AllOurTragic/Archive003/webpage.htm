    Quotation[0] = "&ldquo;The kind of work I strive to be part of, both in rehearsal and performance, is fearless, challenging and still full of joy. A hard trio to accomplish, especially when you are being torn apart by a monster or dealing with 1930's Berlin. But The Hypocrites manage to combine all of these elements in their productions. I have the utmost respect and love for this company.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Jessie Fisher</span>";
    Quotation[1] = "&ldquo;I find the work of the Hypocrites to be both challenging and inspirational. Psychosis 4.48 still haunts me to this day. Just knowing a company like The Hypocrites exists, compels me to work harder and approach my work more innovatively.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-James Palmer</span>";
    Quotation[2] = "&ldquo;The Hypocrites to me represent the pinnacle about what makes Chicago theatre great. Directors, actors, designers are deeply committed but don't take themselves too seriously. They enjoy absolute artistic freedom, and the result is immersive, subversive, beautiful, and complex yet very accessible. Every show is a surprise that turns your definition of theatre on its head and confirms your belief in the power of live performance. The Hypocrites are scrappy, friendly, informal, rough-around-the-edges, and most of all: honest.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Erik Schroeder</span>";
    Quotation[3] = "&ldquo;The Hypocrites took a big chance on me, and gave me my first Chicago job out of school. Working on Cabaret was a magical privilege, and gave me an artistic high I've been chasing ever since. I'm so grateful to the company.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Lindsay Leopold</span>";
    Quotation[4] = "&ldquo;While Chicago has many excellent independent theatre companies, to me The Hypocrites stand apart for their innovation, the extremely high quality of their ensemble performance and the ability to show reverence for a text and yet at the same time be irreverent, in a playful, positive way.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Bart Lazar</span>";
    Quotation[5] = "&ldquo;Working with The Hypocrites has completely spoiled me as an actor; all I want to do now is make crazy, unique, collaborative, fun, and INTERESTING theatre. I am so grateful to this company for giving me an opportunity to do what I love and to look forward to coming to rehearsal every day.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Lindsey Gavel</span>";
    Quotation[6] = "&ldquo;Unlike well-oiled Broadway tours, or big budget theater houses or elite repertory ensembles, The Hypocrites actors and stage hands and directors craft and recraft stories as individuals first so those watching it unfold can intimately connect. This amazing feat is seen through the talent of the ensemble, the director's vision, the production value and the staff, who ask for little, yet give their all.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Lawrence Perea</span>";
    Quotation[7] = "&ldquo;Every theatrical experience put up by The Hypocrites is guaranteed to be thrilling. Buy the ticket, take the ride, and let The Hypocrites take you somewhere you've never been before. It may be hilarious, it may be disturbing, it may be beautiful, it may be all at once, but it will never be boring. With The Hypocrites, live theatre is truly alive.&rdquo; <span class='cite'>-Zeke Sulkes</span>";
