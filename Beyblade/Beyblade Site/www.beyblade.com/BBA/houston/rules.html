Each Championship Event will be governed by (and entrants agree to abide by) the following rules:
<p>
<ol>
<Br><br><li>A 'BATTLE' will consist of 2 Competitors launching their tops into BEYSTADIUM upon the 'REFEREE'S' call of "3,2,1 LET IT RIP!"</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">The 'BATTLE' ends when one top stops spinning.</li>
<Br><br><li>Only one launch is allowed per 'BATTLE'.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Each 'ROUND' will consist of 3 'BATTLES'.</li>
<Br><br><li>If it is determined by the 'REFEREE' that both of the BEYBLADE tops stop spinning at the same time the 'BATTLE' will be declared a 'TIE'.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Each Competitor will compete in 'ROUND 1'. Competitors that win the 'ROUND' will move to the next 'ROUND'. Competitors that lose the 'ROUND' will be eliminated from the competition.</li>
<Br><br><li>The Winner of the 'ROUND' will be the Competitor that wins the majority of the 3 'BATTLES' - either by winning 2 of the 3 'BATTLES' or by winning 1 'BATTLE' when the other 2 'BATTLES' are considered a 'TIE'.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">If a 'ROUND' ends with 3 'TIE' 'BATTLES' additional 'BATTLES' will be played until a 'BATTLE' is won. The winner of that 'BATTTLE' will be declared the winner of that 'ROUND'.</li>
<Br><br><li>All BEYBLADE 'BATTLES' will occur in a BEYSTADIUM.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Semi-Final and Final 'ROUNDS' will occur in the Official BBA BEYBLADE Competition Stadiums.</li>
<Br><br><li>BEYBLADE tops must be launched immediately following the signal "3,2,1 LET IT RIP!"</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Competitors who launch their tops prior to the signal of  "3,2,1 LET IT RIP!" will automatically lose that 'BATTLE'.</li>
<Br><br><li>Competitors who delay the launch of their tops beyond the signal of "3,2,1 LET IT RIP!" will automatically lose that 'BATTLE. </li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">If a Competitor touches his or her Opponent or the Beystadium during the 'BATTLE', they will automatically lose that 'BATTLE'.</li>
<Br><br><li>Competitors must launch their tops from within the designated area.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Competitors cannot launch their tops from a standing, jumping or running position.</li>
<Br><br><li>If a Competitor is not present at the beginning of the 'BATTLE' their Opponent will automatically win by default.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">It is the Competitors responsibility to be present at their assigned BEYSTADIUM with a working top, launcher and rip cord at their pre-determined time.</li>
<Br><br><li>If a top enters a side pocket in the BEYSTADIUM and continues to spin longer than the Opponent's top it will be declared the winner.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">If at any time during the 'BATTLE' a top launches outside BEYSTADIUM it is disqualified and the Opponent will automatically be declared the winner of that 'BATTLE'.</li>
<Br><br><li>Only Official BEYBLADE tops, Stadiums, Rip Cords and Launchers manufactured by Hasbro are eligible for Official BBA tournament play. </li>

<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">If a Competitor is found to be using a non-Official top they will only be allowed to continue in the tournament by using an Official BEYBLADE. </li>
<Br><br><li>If a Competitor suspects an Opponent is using a non-Official top it is their responsibility to communicate this to the 'REFEREE' prior to battle.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">All tops must be assembled and ready for battle once the Competitors enter the tournament area. Competitors are not allowed to reconfigure their tops during the 'ROUND'. </li>
<Br><br><li>If a Competitor is not prepared when the 'BATTLE' begins they will forfeit the 'BATTLE' and their Opponent will win by default.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">BEYBLADE tops that do not disassemble are not allowed for Official BBA tournament play.</li>
<Br><br><li>The use of modified or broken BEYBLADE parts is prohibited.  If parts are found to be broken, worn-out or purposely modified they must be replaced immediately.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">Competitors must ensure their BEYBLADE tops are properly assembled prior to battle.</li>
<Br><br><li>It is prohibited to purposely launch a BEYBLADE at a person at any time.</li>
<Br><br><li><font color="#ccffff">A Competitor can be ejected from the tournament if the Competitor violates regulations and / or performs in an unsportsmanlike manner.</li>
<Br><br><li>Rules are subject to change without notice.</li>
