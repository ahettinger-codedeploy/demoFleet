<p><b>The 2015 Porthouse Theatre Season </b></p>

<p><b>A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC</b></p>

<p><b>June 11-27, 2015</b></p>

<p>Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim</p>

<p>Book by Hugh Wheeler</p>

<p>Orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick</p>

<p>Suggested by a Film by Ingmar Bergman</p>

<p>Originally Produced and Directed on Broadway by Harold Prince</p>

<p>Stephen Sondheim's 19th century romantic waltz whisks us away to a weekend in the country.</p>

<p>Sondheim creates a stunning tour de force when he takes Ingmar Bergman's comedy of manners, Smiles of a Summer Night, and turns it into a musical of masterful execution and elegance. Winner of four TONY Awards, this is a musical work that has forever entranced the world of theatre. </p>

<p>Set in 1900 Sweden, A Little Night Music explores the tangled web of affairs centered around actress Desirée Armfeldt and the men who love her: a lawyer by the name of Fredrik Egerman and the Count Carl-Magnus Malcom. When the traveling actress performs in Fredrik's town, the estranged lovers' passion rekindles. This strikes a flurry of jealousy and suspicion between Desirée, Fredrik, Fredrick's wife, Anne, Desirée's current lover, the Count, and the Count's wife, Charlotte. Both men -- as well as their jealous wives -- agree to join Desirée and her family for a weekend in the country at Desirée's mother's estate. With everyone in one place, infinite possibilities of new romances and second chances bring endless surprises.</p>

<p>A Little Night Music is full of hilariously witty and heartbreakingly moving moments of adoration, regret and desire. This dramatic musical celebration of love is perfect to showcase your highly-trained singers with it's harmonically-advanced score and masterful orchestrations and contains Sondheim's popular song, the haunting "Send in the Clowns." </p>

<p><b>HAIRSPRAY VIOLET</b></p>

<p><b>July 9- 25, 2015</b></p>

<p>Music by Jeanine Tesori</p>

<p>Lyrics and Book by Brian Crawley</p>

<p>Based on the “The Ugliest Pilgrim” by Doris Betts</p>

<p>On a cross-country bus trip in search of a minister to heal her scarred face, one woman discovers the true meaning of beauty, courage and love.</p>

<p>Winner of the Drama Critics’ Circle Award and Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical when it premiered off-Broadway, Violet features a score of show-stopping anthems ranging from American-roots to folk to gospel from one of most vibrant composers of modern musical theatre - Jeanine Tesori (Caroline Or Change, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Shrek). With its powerful story Violet has astounded critics and audiences alike making it one of the most acclaimed off-Broadway shows of the ’90s. </p>

<p>As a girl, Violet was struck by a wayward axe blade when her father was chopping wood, leaving her with a visible scar across her face. With enough money finally saved she's traveling across the 1964 Deep South towards a miracle - the healing touch of a TV evangelist that will make her beautiful. Though she may not succeed in having the scar on her face healed, Violet is able to repair those that are lying deeper than her skin; and on the way she meets a young, African-American Soldier whose love for her reaches far past her physical "imperfections". </p>

<p>With its immaculately crafted, multi-genre score whose lyrics and book are from the fantastic Brian Crawley (A Little Princess), Violet is a powerhouse piece of theatre that needs no more than a few chairs and talented performers to take an audience's breath away. It is a must for companies dedicated to depicting moving stories on their stage. </p>
