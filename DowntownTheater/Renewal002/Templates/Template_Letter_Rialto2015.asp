			<p>Dear Metropolitan Opera Subscriber:</p>

			<p>We are delighted to announce that season tickets are now available for the <strong><em>2015-2016 Metropolitan Opera Live in HD</em></strong> season at Rialto Cinemas &#8211; bringing the best films and the best big screen events in the world to Sonoma County.</p> 

			<p>The tenth season of <strong><em>The Met: Live in HD</em></strong> features ten glorious operas including five that have never been presented in previous <em>Live in HD</em> seasons and six new productions!</p> 

			<p>Rialto Cinemas&#174; is proud to have been one of 76 theatres to present all of the Met&#8217;s Live in HD seasons. Since its inception <em>The Met: Live in HD</em> has presented 87 live operas to 70 countries to an estimated 17 million opera lovers worldwide!</p> 

			<p>The 2015-16 Season of <em>The Met: Live in HD</em> includes five works being seen in HD for the first time: Wagner&#8217;s <strong><em>Tannhauser</em></strong>, Berg&#8217;s <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong>, Bizet&#8217;s <strong><em>Les Pecheurs de Perles</em></strong>, Donizetti&#8217;s <strong><em>Roberto Devereux</em></strong>, and Strauss&#8217; <strong><em>Elektra</em></strong>! New productions include <strong><em>Il Trovatore</em></strong>, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong>,    <strong><em>Les Pecheurs de Perles</em></strong>, <strong><em>Manon Lescaut</em></strong>, <strong><em>Roberto Devereux</em></strong> which is also a Met Premiere and <strong><em>Elektra</em></strong>.</p> 

			<p>You won&#8217;t want to miss Anna Netrebko in her Met debut as Leonora, the tortured heroine of <strong><em>Il Trovatore</em></strong>. Bartlett Sher brings a new production of Verdi&#8217;s masterpiece <strong><em>Otello</em></strong> while James Levine conducts the first Met revival of Wagner&#8217;s    <strong><em>Tannhauser</em></strong> since 2004. Inventive visual artist William Kittridge returns to the Met with <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong>, his first new production since <em>The Nose</em>. The last time Bizet&#8217;s lush, melodic romance <strong><em>Les Pecheurs de Perles</em></strong> was seen at the Met was in 1916 when Enrico Caruso starred.</p> 

			<p>Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme sings her first Met performances of the demanding title role of Puccini&#8217;s Chinese ice princess in <strong><em>Turandot</em></strong> while Kristine Opolais and Jonas Kaufmann star as the ill-fated lovers at the center of Sir Richard Eyre&#8217;s new production of <strong><em>Manon Lescaut</em></strong>. Kristine Opolais brings her heartbreaking interpretation of the title role in <strong><em>Madama Butterfly</em></strong><em> </em>to Live in HD for the first time.</p> 

			<p><strong><em>Roberto Devereux</em></strong> is both a Met Premiere and the final opera in Donizetti&#8217;s &#8220;Tudor trilogy.&#8221; Acclaimed bel canto soprano Sondra Radvanovsky will sing Elizabeth I in    <strong><em>Roberto Devereux</em></strong> as well as the title roles in <em>Anna Bolena</em> and <em>Maria Stuarda</em> over the course of the season, a famous feat performed by Beverly Sills at New York City Opera in the 1970s and not repeated in New York since.</p> 

			<p>The season concludes with <strong><em>Elektra</em></strong> Strauss&#8217; blazing tragedy about an ancient Greek princess hell-bent on revenge in the final opera production by the legendary director Patrice Chereau being seen for the first time at the Met.</p>
