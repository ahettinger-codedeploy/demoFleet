<p> Dear National Theatre Live Subscriber: </p>

<p> Under the auspices of National Theatre Live we have brought you some of the very best of London theatre from the National Theatre as well as productions from London's West End (<em>The Audience, Skylight, Hamlet </em>starring Benedict Cumberbatch), the Donmar Warehouse (<em>Coriolanus, Les Liaisons Dangeruses, The Cherry Orchard</em>)<em> </em>, Theatre Complicite (<em>A Disappearing Number</em>), The Royal Court (    <em>Hangmen</em>), The Young Vic (<em>A View From The Bridge, A Streetcar Named Desire</em>), and The Manchester Festival (<em>Macbeth</em>). </p>

<p> Now, separate from National Theatre Live, we are thrilled to announce fresh from it's sell-out run at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre a cinema presentation of their ground breaking new production of <strong>Hamlet</strong> starring BAFTA nominee Maxine Peake in the title role. Yes, we've presented other versions of <strong>Hamlet</strong> including the most recent one starring Benedict Cumberbatch. However, this unique and critically acclaimed production has been heralded as "a triumph of re-invention&#8230;intimate and intense&#8230;stunningly good" by <em>The Times</em>. The    <em>Financial Times</em> raves "Peake plays Hamlet as a boy, vividly grasping the verse." Maxine Peake as Hamlet "is gripping, the otherness of her femininity combining with the familiarity of the lines into theatrical doublethink. With cropped blonde hair, Peake cuts a boyish figure in a Mao-style jacket. Her interpretation is fresh, angry, and occasionally funny" <em>The Times </em>continues. </p>

<p> As a subscriber to the National Theatre Live series at Rialto Cinemas, we are sending you this priority notice of the presentation of <strong>Hamlet</strong> starring Maxine Peake and providing you the opportunity to purchase your same great National Theatre Live seats before they are offered to the general public. </p>
