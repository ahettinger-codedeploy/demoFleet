Dear National Theatre Live Subscriber:
</p>

<p>
Following a sell-out run at London's Royal Court Theatre, Olivier and Academy Award&#174; winner Martin McDonagh (<em>The Pillowman</em>,    <em>The Lieutenant of Inishmore</em>, <em>In Bruges</em><strong>, </strong><em>Seven Psychopaths</em>) returns to the West End with Matthew Dunster's
award-winning production of his deeply funny new play <strong>Hangmen</strong>, captured live by National Theatre Live.
</p>

<p>
In his small pub in the northern English town of Oldham, Harry (David Morrissey - <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>State of Play</em>) is something of a
local celebrity. But what's the second-best hangman in England to do on the day they've abolished hanging?
</p>

<p>
Amongst the cub reporters and pub regulars dying to hear Harry's reaction to the news, his old assistant Syd (Andy Nyman - <em>Peaky Blinders</em>,    <em>Death at a Funeral</em>) and the peculiar Mooney (Johnny Flynn - <em>Clouds of Sils Maria</em>) lurk with very different motives for their visit.
</p>

<p>
The Daily Telegraph proclaims <strong>Hangmen</strong> is "the best new play of the year" and awarded the production five stars. The Independent calls    <strong>Hangmen</strong> "drop-dead hilarious" and also gives the production five stars.
</p>
