Dear National Theatre Live Subscriber:
</p>

<p>
One of the hottest tickets in London this season is the&nbsp;<strong><em>Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company's Plays at The Garrick.</em></strong>&nbsp;We are excited to
announce a new partnership with the&nbsp;<strong><em>Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company</em></strong>&nbsp;to bring three of the acclaimed productions to our theatres
in 2016!
</p>

<p>
We begin in January with Shakespeare's&nbsp;<strong>The Winter's Tale</strong>&nbsp;starring Dame Judi Dench as Paulina and Kenneth Branagh as Leontes. Co-directed
by Rob Ashford and Kenneth Branagh, Shakespeare's timeless tragicomedy of obsession and redemption is reimagined in a new production which follows the
directors' triumphant stagings of&nbsp;<strong>Macbeth</strong>&nbsp;in Manchester (seen as part of National Theatre Live) and Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
In late summer we will present Mr Branagh's production of&nbsp;<strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>&nbsp;and round out the three play season in the fall of 2016 with
John Osborne's&nbsp;<strong>The Entertainer</strong>&nbsp;directed by Rob Ashford and starring Kenneth Branagh as the unforgettable Archie Rice. Because of the way
the plays are being licensed for theatrical exhibition we are only able to sell tickets for&nbsp;<strong>The Winter's Tale</strong>&nbsp;at this time.
</p>
