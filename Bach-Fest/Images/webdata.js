As one of the largest Baroque music events in North America, our mission is to be a leader in the community, locally and globally, by presenting performances of the highest artistic quality; to develop successful new vehicles ‚Äì educational, social, technological and spiritual - for presenting Johann Sebastian Bach‚Äôs music; and to attract and enlighten enthusiastic, loyal, and diverse audiences from around the world. Founded by the late Michael Korn in 1976, the Bach Festival has given numerous landmark performances with its former ensembles in residence, the Philadelphia Singers and the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. The Bach Festival is currently under the artistic leadership of Maestro Jonathan Sternberg who conducted one of the very first recordings ever of JS Bach‚Äôs cantatas in 1950. With that we wish you a wonderful season with us and hope to meet you soon at our concerts.

The ten-day festival around JS Bach \'s birthday (March 21) presented over 30 events ranging from period instrument performances and choral arts to electronic remixes, dance, film, multimedia, educational programs, world premieres and worships with artists, scholars and composers from Europe, the U.S. and Latin America. They took place in many neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia from the German Society in the North and the National Shrine of St. Rita of Cascia in the South, the Annenberg Center in University City to St. Peter \'s on Society Hill including suburban areas like Bryn Mawr and Chestnut Hill where The Bach Festival was founded in 1976.  The Bach Festival is full of smart and fresh ideas , David Stearns wrote in the Philadelphia Inquirer on March 19: Indeed, there was a lot of variety. In addition to regular concerts, lectures and educational programs with Baroque music, there were several concerts with music based on JS Bach. Two of the piano recitals, for example, featured works by Liszt and Reger as well as two premieres of works based on Bach chorales performed on a special Fazioli grand piano with the composers lecturing. Almost every night, organ postludes by Michael Stairs, Peter Conte and Matt Glandorf followed performances at Kimmel Center \'s Verizon Hall:  What a thrill it was to have nearly 2000 people stay and hear the great B Minor Prelude and Fugue on the stunning Dobson organ. Several of my colleagues in the Philadelphia Orchestra reported that they were coming back and bringing friends! So, thank you for this great opportunity to celebrate the master \'s 322nd birthday!  Michael Stairs, Philadelphia Orchestra organist As in 2005, when five congregations for the first time performed Bach \'s five masses as part of services, two worships at St. Peter \'s and Christ Church included Bach cantatas.  We had an increase in the normal Sabbath numbers of approx. 30%. All went successfully and, I think, from recent feed-back, we were all very glad to have participated. To have the additional support and encouragement of The Bach Festival and its leadership has been, for me, a total blessing.  John Binsfeld, Christ Church music director On top, this year \'s Festival Week included two film screenings of the movie  Mein Name ist Bach  at the German Society; a multimedia piece based on Bach at Andrea Clearfield \'s packed Salon and a sold-out modern dance performance on Bach \'s violin solo partitas.  It was a deeply satisfying event for audience and performers alike. Being part of the Festival leant an air of celebration; honoring Bach \'s birthday together with many other performing artists and audience members.  Lisa Kraus, Partita Dance Project Three marketing goals were pursued with the coalition \'s focus of events on ten days instead of spreading them over the year. 1)  Mutual awareness : to cross-fertilize existing audiences and increase their interest to attend each others events in addition to events of organizations they already know of. 2)  Festival hype  to get additional audiences interested in something extraordinary happening in town they would normally not know of or attend. 3)  Entice tourism : to 1    Report on the International > Bach Festival Week > Philadelphia March 16-25, 2007  heighten awareness on the East Coast and beyond of one of the largest Baroque music festivals in the U.S. being in Philadelphia in order to increase tourism from outside the region. According to the available data from online sales, audience surveys, exit polls, and reports from the participating organizations, these goals were met as far as one could expect this time. It will take several seasons, though, to gain momentum and fully achieve them. 1) Mutual awareness: Some organizations showed audience increases by 30% while others reported no significant effect (it should be noted that at Opening Night a devastating snowstorm hit Philadelphia). One organization reported decreased turnout and complaints of overlaps with other concerts, although the International > Bach Festival Week > Philadelphia is not yet at the level of Philly Fringe or the Boston Early Music Festival with hundreds of parallel events. Audiences overall showed high diversity ranging in age from two weeks old (!) to late 80s, including a great variety of cultural backgrounds people choose to base their identity on such as Irish, Quaker, Afro-American and gay. As in 2006, the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance contributed a uniting website to the coalition at PhillyFunGuide.com/bachbuster that listed all events (see attachment). This page was prominently displayed by The Bach Festival on all printed materials (program books, flyers, postcards) and referenced by the other participants in email blasts and/or on homepages in order to direct all traffic to it. The  BachBuster  received 5874 page views, which is 25% more than the year before. Thus, as an event, the Festival Week ranked again in the top 10 for March. 2) Festival hype: Media coverage was much better than in previous years and more than any single organization could have achieved alone. The cover story in the weekend addition to the Philadelphia Inquirer listing all Festival Week events and a feature on WRTI testify to the citywide attention the Festival Week received this season. These and other coverage can be accessed at Bach-Fest.org/clippings.aspx. 3) Entice tourism: The Bach Festival bought ad space in Washington, DC, arranged email blasts in NYC and sent direct mail targeted to specific segments in PA, NJ and DE through the Cultural Alliance \'s list coop. In addition, the Independence Visitor Center hosted several promotional events for tourists and offered ticketing to Festival Week events. However, the fact that the participant couldn \'t work out a joint Festival Week pass or finance a joint brochure listing all events in detail was a drawback that needs to be tackled. We also plan to improve tourism offers by scheduling more events during the day such as Bach@Noon recitals and an  agora  in form of an exhibition of music dealers (instruments, scores, agents, CDs, paraphernalia etc). Expanded partnerships with hotels, restaurant and international tour agencies should foster this goal as well. Already 10% of the Bach Festival \'s audiences came from Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey to Delaware, Washington, DC, and Virginia. Although we cannot track overnight stays except those with The Bach Festival \'s hotel partner, it is safe to assume that many guests from those states did stay overnight. The International > Bach Festival Week > Philadelphia is just beginning to take shape, but already one of the largest Baroque music festivals in the U.S., supported with grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, the William Penn Foundation, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia and many individuals and corporations. Think about where this coalition can go, what we can achieve for the city \'s national reputation and for the vitality of its arts scene in the years to come.

Name Title Organization Address Michael Korn (1947-1991) Michael Korn was born near Harrisburg, PA in 1947. Having been a child prodigy, he founded his own choral-orchestral society in Germantown at age 19. After graduating from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1968, he became the only organist ever chosen by Leonard Bernstein to join him on CBS Televisionís legendary ìYoung Peopleís Concertsî. In the following decade, he established his reputation as one of Americaís finest young conductors. In 1972, he founded the Philadelphia Singers, Philadelphiaís first and only professional chorus and led the ensemble until his untimely death in 1991. Milestones of the Singers under Kornís leadership range from the 1976 sell-out concert at the Great Stair Hall of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the first recording ever of Handelís Roman Vespers with Benita Valente as soloist on RCA. Today, The Philadelphia Singers as well as the enlarged Philadelphia Singers Chorale (both under the leadership of his former assistant conductor David Hayes) flourishes as the Philadelphia Orchestraís Resident Chorus. In 1976, Korn founded the Bach Festival of Philadelphia and quickly developed it into a leading Baroque music event with numerous international stars coming to Philadelphia. These range from Johann Sebastian Bachís own St. Thomas Boys Choir Leipzig through Joshua Rifkin, Marietta Simpson, Gustav Leonhardt, the Washington Bach Consort, Musica Antiqua Cologne, The Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, and Helmuth Rilling to Christoph Wolff. It has produced many landmark performances with its former resident ensembles, the Philadelphia Singers and Marc Mostovoyís Concerto Soloists, now the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. In this time, many of Philadelphiaís prime musicians have worked with Korn such as David Finckel, Michael Stairs, and Doralene Davis. Most notably was the PBS TV show hosted by Tony Randall for the 300 th anniversary of Bach and Handel in 1985. In 1977, Michael Korn founded Chorus America, the national service organization for professional choruses, and served as the organizationís president till 1985. By the beginning of the 1980s, he prepared all of the professional choral work in Philadelphia in his dual capacity with the Philadelphia Singers and as Associate Conductor and Chorus Master of the Opera Company of Philadelphia. Thus, he had a unique impact on the musical scene of the city. Already marked by the disease, he gave his last public concert on March 1991 on the Avenue of the Arts with Mozartís Requiem at the Academy of Music with The Philadelphia Singers Chorale and the Concerto Soloists. On August 29, 1991, Michael Korn died of complications from AIDS - Philadelphia lost one of its musical geniuses.",12);arrFiles[5]=new Array(6,"podcast.aspx","2001-01-01","The Bach Festival of Philadelphia - Podcast","Bach, Bachfest, Bach-fest, Bach-festival, Festival, Fest, Phila, Philly, Philadelphia, Sternberg, Houben, Sebastian, Johann, Music, Baroque, Period, Oregon, Bethlehem, Leipzig, Wolff, St. Thomas, Brandenburg, B minor, Passion, Future, Chestnut Hill, Cant","","Podcast Setup Bach Festival Orchestra ‚Äì Live in Concert at St. Rita‚Äôs National Shrine Dennis Schmidt - Complete Organ Works of Bach Jonathan Sternberg - Bach Cantatas Markus Eichenlaub - Selected Organ Works of Bach Setup To listen to the performances, just install a podcast program (rss reader) like iTunes on your computer and subscribe to: www.bach-fest.org/podcast.xml (e.g., in iTunes, go to the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù menu and click Subscribe to Podcast and enter the above link).

This history is hard to top. But you seemed to like the events, which again spread out all over Philadelphia, from the Woodmere Art Museum in the Northwest to the National Shrine of St. Rita of Cascia in Philly \'s South. The complete sets of the Clavierubung, of the Cello Suites and of Bach \'s orchestral works with international stars like Matt Haimowitz great Philadelphia artists like Gary Graffman and Francesca dePasquale were a great success: audience numbers doubled this season per concert! Another artistic focus was on educational outreach for schools and parents and on providing opportunities for young artists and ensembles to perform with us. You will be excited to read about this season \'s International JS Bach Vocal Competition and our young artist concerts! The past 30 years would not have been possible without so many dedicated board members and their Presidents Karl Spaeth, Martin Heckscher, Karen vdH Butler, Tony Carey, and Samuel Swansen; without passionate staff working with Executive Directors such as Mary Sue Welsh and Janice Fiore; without dedicated volunteers of whom there are too many to list them all; and, of course, without so many who make a financial contribution. This year, we are again particularly grateful to John & Chara Haas and to our former chairman Allen Model. Their visionary support turns the Bach Festival into an even greater Baroque music event on the East Coast and into a hub of the city \'s leading producing, presenting, and promoting organizations. Join their passion and help us giving Bach to the community! But first enjoy reviewing the achievements of the past season with this report. Building strength through information, as the PA Cultural Data Project teaches us all, we try to provide the most useful information for you to get as excited about the Bach Festival as we are. Yours truly,  John L. Fowler, Esq.  -3-    Executive Summary The 30th anniversary season has been a very successful one in the history of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. It celebrated the legacy of our three artistic leaders over the past 30 years: Michael Korn (1976-1988), Dr. Dennis Schmidt (1993-2000), and Jonathan Sternberg (since 2004). dards, enhancing the cultural life of the entire Philadelphia region. Focusing on the rich heritage of music created by Johann Sebastian Bach and his Baroque contemporaries, the Bach Festival sought to provide a unique forum for local, national and international artists who perform programs that enlighten and enrich the lives of Delaware Valley audiences. We strive to engage the local communities of Philadelphia in music- and art-related activities and to increase business opportunities and tourism for the area. The 30th anniversary season program continued this mission, bringing the finest international musicians to a fair number of venues in the city. We believe that it is important for a vital community that world-class concerts take place in many diverse neighborhoods. This particularly benefits retired and impaired people to participate in local activities. The stream of outside musicians and visitors our concerts bring to communities has also been beneficial for local shops and restaurants. The Bach Festival offered a broad portfolio of Baroque music unrivaled in terms of quantity and quality by any other organization in town. The 30th anniversary season prepared the ground to reestablish the Bach Festival of Philadelphia as an important event in the international Baroque music scene.  Michael Korn with Chairman Edna Philips  The 30th Anniversary Season continued the renewed artistic excellence, exciting programming, lean management and fiscal prudence. This resulted in contributions and awards from many previous supporters and also new sources. In addition, we improved our cost structure, strengthened profitability, and improved marketing and development. These efforts enabled the Bach Festival to make a good showing in 2005/06 both in terms of audience numbers and revenues. Our musical performances, lectures and educational programs were again of the highest stan-  -4-    1. Artistic Excellence What started out as a weekend long community event in Chestnut Hill in 1976 developed into a concert series of several weekends, then months all over Philadelphia. Increasingly, our focus lies on the 10-day Festival Week around Bach \'s birthday March 21 in cooperation with other organizations producing, presenting & promoting the arts. The Bach Festival Week in March 2006 presented almost all of JS Bach \'s orchestral works (BWV 1041-1070) including the complete cycles of the Brandenburg Concertos, the Suites, and the Violin Concertos. In addition, Gary Graffman delighted his audiences with Johannes Brahms \' transcription of Bach \'s Chaconne in D Minor, considered his ultimate work by many. Maestro Sternberg \'s Philadelphia Bach Festival Orchestra provided excellent opportunities for many young local artists to present their view on Bach. This season Jason DePue, Francesca dePasquale, Caeli Smith, Gloria Justen, Luigi Mazzochi, Solomiya Ivakhiv and Prema Kesselman excelled as concertmaster and soloists. The venues covered many neighborhoods such as Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church in the West with Jeannette Sorrell \'s Cleveland Baroque Orchestra  Apollo \'s Fire ; the National Shrine of St. Rita of Cascia in Philly \'s South; the Ethical Society and Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square; St. Peter \'s in the Historic District; the German Society of Pennsylvania and the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel in the North; and in the Northwest the Woodmere Art Museum, St. Martin \'s and the Baptist Church as well as our own St. Paul \'s of Chestnut Hill with Melvin Kaplan \'s New York Chamber Soloists.  Francesca dePasquale  In recognition of its excellent artistic quality the Philadelphia Presenting Project awarded the Bach Festival  5,000 for a performance at the Annenberg Center in the 2006/07 season. As a special for the 30th Anniversary Season, we offered a guided tour with Maestro Jonathan Sternberg to the Bachfest Leipzig, to the Reichstag and the Jewish Memorial in Germany \'s vibrant capital Berlin, Dresden \'s just restored famous Frauenkirche and the New Leipzig School of Painting.  -5-    The monthly ancillary concerts throughout the season combined cutting edge programs with high artistic quality. The Opening Night presented JS Bach \'s opus 1, the Six Partitas, with Jeremy Denk (see article from September 21, 2005 below by David Patrick Stearns of the Philadelphia Inquirer). The remaining three parts of the Clavier¸bung, i.e. the Goldberg Variations with Jory Vinikour; the Italian Concerto and the French Overture with Eric Fung, and the Organ Mass were presented in October and November 2005. Particularly the Six Cello Suites with well-known stars Matt Haimowitz and Paul Galbraith proved to be sell-outs. The organ concerts of Markus Eichenlaub and Paula Romanaux were also very popular.  Matt Haimowitz  -6-    The Bach Festival \'s educational outreach established two goals: educating new audiences, particularly children and teenager, and fostering the development of young professionals (see above). To counterbalance rising musical illiteracy levels in the worsened public school system, we continued to offer ten percent of all our regular concert tickets for free to pre-collegiate school classes. We have partnered for their distribution with Strings for Schools an organization that works continuously with most schools of Greater Philadelphia. On a more playful note, Mr. Bach \'s Birthday Party, around March 21, is an annual event to introduce children (and their parents!) to the music of J.S. Bach through music presentations and activities, dances, costumes, and discussions. The International JS Bach Vocal Competition featured the most beautiful of JS Bach \'s arias and Lieder sung by future vocal stars. Ten candidates from India, Russia, Chile, Canada, the UK and the U.S. had been chosen to battle for glory at the International JS Bach Vocal Competition. The  S‰ngerkrieg  took appropriately place at the German Society of Pennsylvania in North Philadelphia. The jury with notables such as Julianne Baird and Suzanne DuPlantis awarded Yulia van  Doren from Boston  1,000 and an engagement as soloist in a major production of the Bach Festival during the 2006/07 season.  President John Fowler and Maestro Jonathan Sternberg congratulate First Prize Winner Yulia van Doren  The 30th anniversary season was dedicated to the memory of the founder of the Bach Festival, Chorus America, and the Philadelphia Singers and will end with a Michael Korn Memorial Weekend. During the first 15 years of the Bach Festival \'s existence, Michael Korn inspired all those who were surrounded by his musical genius; for the past 15 years we have had to carry on without his inspiration. Thus, in October 2006 we will commemorate his 15th anniversary with a replica of the first  Basically Bach Festival  weekend of 1976 (for the repertoire see the following list) with the Philadelphia Singers.  -7-    Repertoire 1976 - 2006  (Only Works by JS Bach listed)  No. BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV BWV 11 12 23 29 34 38 40 46 50 51 61 63 65 71 78 80 82 91 106 110 119 120 131 132 137 140 147 171 196 199 202 208 209 211 213 225 226 227 228 229 230 232 233 234 235 236 243 Work Title Vocal Works (Cantatas, Motets, Masses) Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen (Ascension Oratorio) Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen (S.

Organizational Outreach During the 30th anniversary season, the Bach Festival continued to build up its organizational capacity. The work of the previous season had been honored by the Pew Charitable Trusts \' Philadelphia Music Project (PMP) with an invitation to participate in its Planning and Organizational Development Program with the consulting firm Arts Action Research (AAR). The consultancy work undertaken by AAR was conducted over the course of a one-year period and helped us prepare for strategic partnerships with promoting, presenting, and producing organizations. Staff and board also attended a number of PMP seminars such as  Arts Marketing & Audience Development ,  Internet Marketing , and board development. Thus, the 30th Anniversary Season brought a number of changes to our Board of Directors. First, we created a board of artistic advisors out of the board of directors. Then, on February 1, the Board of Directors elected John Fowler, Esq. as new President of the Board. His predecessor Samuel Swansen continues to serve as Secretary, thus guaranteeing a smooth transition. Furthermore, the Board elected Guido Gaeffke, Dr. Vanaja Ragavan, and Stephen Varenhorst to succeed Dr. George Spaeth, Otto Reichert-Facilides, and Harold Thompson who retired after many years of service. We continued our good relationship with the Arts & Business Council (ABC), which bear fruits through the Business Volunteers for the Arts Program (BVA). Christopher Hughes developed with us a tool to better monitor the cash flow management of the Bach Festival. The Bach Festival \'s main promotional partner this season was the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance (GPCA). Through GPCA \'s Cooperative Advertising Program the Bach Festival was able for the first time in years to  get Bach on air . Thanks to the generous support of Peter Benoliel, Richard & Happy Fernandez, Therese Casadesus Rawson, and Rosemarie Gaeffke, 44 radio ads were broadcast on Philadelphia \'s four main stations the month before the Festival Week. In addition, we offered lastminute tickets half price for selected shows through the PhillyFunSaver program. GPCA developed a blockbuster on PhillyFunGuide.org featuring the Bach Festival Week. This  BachBuster  was a further development of the  Bach 2 Phila Net Project  (see www.BachFest.org/B2P-NP.aspx) to promote the Bach related events of all the musical forces who presented Bach during the Festival Week in March. Finally, the Bach Festival also received a grant to participate in the Alliance \'s Peer Mentorship Program and the National Arts Marketing Project Conference in Los Angeles. This award helped us preparing a marketing strategy for the Michael Korn Memorial Weekend.  - 13 -    15 years after his untimely death on August 29, 1991, Michael Korn has been suggested to be included on Philadelphia \'s Walk of Fame on the Avenue of the Arts. Many people from Pennsylvania and outside the region supported the induction this fall as documented on our website. We relaunched both the Bach Festival \'s website (www.BachFest.org) as well as the Global Bach Community \'s (www.BachNet.org). GBC is a non-profit organization hosted by the Bach Festival connecting the global Bach community. They are now offering major improvements in regard to transparency, services, tie-in merchandise, and archival information such as articles, pictures, reviews and program books from the past 30 years. In terms of marketing, we further built up the email list of 3,000 subscribers who receive the Festival \'s monthly newsletter  Come Bach  and a database of over 11,000 households who receive the annual program brochure. Probably as the first Bach Festival world-wide we offer Bach \'s music 24/7 starting with the recordings of our three artistic directors. At Bach-Fest.org/podcast.aspx you can listen for free to Bach \'s complete organ works recorded by Dr. Dennis Schmidt for the tercentenary in 1985. The first recordings ever of several Bach cantatas recorded by  Maestro Sternberg with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Choir and Daniel Pinkham at the harpsichord are represented as well.  Dr. Dennis Schmidt  As a next step, we look forward to uploading the vast archives of the Korn years. Unfortunately, the Philadelphia Singers have not yet released their part of the copyright to upload the recordings. During the Bach Festival Week 2006, we were also able to do our first recording in years thanks to a generous donation from Inna Heasley. This is particularly important for grant applications and merchandise sales. Michael Caruso \'s following article from the Philadelphia Music Makers No. 2/ 2006 testifies to the citywide attention the Bach Festival has received during this season.  - 14 -    Bach Festival born anew  By Michael Caruso For those of us who recall the glory days of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia, when the late Michael Korn was at its helm, this year \'s installment brought back fond memories and sparked bright hopes. Under the leadership of executive director Guido Houben and artistic and music director Jonathan Sternberg, the Bach Festival has rebounded and once again occupies a prominent place in Greater Philadelphia \'s classical music landscape. Michael Korn was the motivating force behind the founding of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia thirty years ago. As the founder and artistic director of the Philadelphia Singers (the first fully professional chorus in America) and the director of the Opera Company of Philadelphia Chorus, as well as a close collaborator with many of the other leading music directors in Philadelphia, Korn was in an ideal position to bring into being one of the region \'s most admired musical projects. Centering the Bach Festival almost exclusively in Chestnut Hill and performing most of its concerts in several of the lovely churches located in that section of the city, Korn modeled the Bach Festival of Philadelphia on those taking place in Europe. Over the span of two or three weekends each autumn, a series of concerts and recitals were given that often spanned a specific aspect of Johann Sebastian Bach \'s prodigious and inspired output. By involving other locally based ensembles such as the then-named Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia, led by their founder Marc Mostovoy, along with the Curtis Institute of Music and its cadre of incredibly talented young musicians, and calling upon the countless topnotch freelance players in Greater Philadelphia, Korn created a festival of Bach \'s music that achieved national and even international acclaim in a few short years. When differences of opinion regarding producing, presenting and/or promoting concerts arose between Korn and some members of the festival \'s board of directors, plus an increase in the budget deficit, Korn resigned as music director. Much like the decline of Spain following the defeat of the Armada in 1588, the deterioration of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia was immediate and profound. The bloom was off the lily and the lights were incrementally turned off. The festival \'s season shrank to a mere shadow of its former self, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and its spirit very nearly withered away and died. But much like the music of Bach itself--almost completely forgotten after his death in 1750 until Felix Mendelssohn rediscovered it after his appointment in Bach \'s town of Leipzig--the appreciation of that canon of masterpieces and the treasured memories of so many great performances of those scores were only hidden, not lost. It only demanded  Guido Houben, executive director of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia  12    something like Michael Korn \'s inimitable musicality and intense perseverance to stage a renaissance of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. In his youth, perhaps Jonathan Sternberg could have done it all by himself. Fortunately for the octogenarian Chestnut Hill maestro, his command over the music of Bach has been joined to Guido Houben \'s administrative expertise and energy. Houben was born in one of Germany \'s most historically prominent cities. Located in the southwest state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Trier is the oldest city in Germany that was formerly a fortress of the ancient Roman Empire. Its importance to the Romans is attested to by its possession of one of the holiest of Christian relics, the Seamless Robe worn by Jesus Christ. Discovered in the Holy Land by St. Helena, the mother of the first Christian Emperor, Constantine the Great, the robe was given a shrine in Trier early in the third century A.D. It is displayed every forty years as a mark of reverence. On a more profane note of notoriety, Trier was also the birthplace of Karl Marx. Houben \'s interest in music was immediate. His father gave him lessons on piano and organ and he studied liturgical music while a teenager. It should be remembered that Bach was the cantor for St. Thomas Evangelical Lutheran Church in Leipzig for the last decades of his life, composing more than three hundred cantatas for the Protestant liturgy as well as countless other religious scores. Houben eventually earned a master \'s degree in music composition as well as in the Russian language, and a doctorate in political science. He also studied at the Glinka Conservatory and the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut. For the four years following graduation, Houben worked in the office of a member of Germany \'s Federal Bundestag, akin to the United States House of Representatives. He focused on the financial activities of cultural groups, including music festivals and other treasured institutions throughout the country.  I was able to see how budgets were constructed,  Houben explained. In those days, the cultural budget of the Federal Republic of Germany was worth about  1 billion, plus an additional  50 billion spent by the individual state and local governments throughout the country. Houben found a far less generous governmental  Jonathan Sternberg conducting  environment when he came to work in America. But he didn \'t come unprepared. He studied administration at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, focusing his efforts on the workings of nonprofit organizations and their strategies for fundraising. Applying for and receiving a visa and legal status, Houben decided to remain in the United States. In 2004, he was offered the job of executive director of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. He accepted the post in July of that year, approximately four months after Jonathan Sternberg was hired as artistic director. He found an organization mostly unprepared for the coming season, lots of debt, virtually no money, and nearly no program. In little more than a month, Houben and Sternberg put together their first season. But they also set their sights on the 2005-06 season, which would begin the celebration of the Festival \'s thirtieth anniversary and the marking of the fifteenth anniversary of Michael Korn \'s death in August 1991.  It was its great past and traditions and my friendship with Jonathan Sternberg that attracted me to the Bach Festival,  Houben explained.  And Philadelphia has so much potential for a great Bach Festival. There are so many excellent musical ensembles. They all have supportive audiences. They \'re perfect for partnerships with the Bach Festival.  One of the most ambitious portions of the Bach Festival \'s 2005-06 season was its Festival Week in March of 2006. All the major orchestral works of Bach--the  Brandenburg  Concerti and the Orchestral Suites plus several solo and grosso concerti 13    --were performed in four concerts that took place in four different churches. The performers included two touring ensembles as well as the Philadelphia Bach Festival Orchestra. The series opened on March 17 when the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra played in the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church, making the first use of the sanctuary \'s newly reverberant acoustics. The following evening, Jonathan Sternberg led the Festival Orchestra at St. Rita of Cascia National Shrine Roman Catholic Church on Broad Street in South Philadelphia, pairing the church \'s Sicilian Baroque architecture with Bach \'s German Baroque music. Sternberg and the Festival Orchestra gave their second concert on March 25 in the Victorian Romanesque splendor of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square in Center City. The series concluded the following afternoon with the New York Chamber Soloists heard in St. Paul \'s Episcopal Church in Chestnut Hill. Other programs were presented in the Ethical Society on Rittenhouse Square, the Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill, Keneseth Israel synagogue  in Elkins Park, Chestnut Hill \'s Woodmere Art Museum, the Baptist Church of Chestnut Hill, and St. Peter \'s Episcopal Church in Society Hill.  Mr. Bach \'s Birthday Party  for children was held in Chestnut Hill \'s Episcopal Church of St. Martin-in-the-Field and an international vocal competition was held at the German Society of Pennsylvania. Looking into the future, Houben and Sternberg hope to present, produce, and promote a vast array of concerts, recitals, and activities on an even larger scale.  There are so many fine ensembles right here in Philadelphia,  he said,  and many are already performing programs of Bach \'s music and the music of other Baroque composers. You have Piffaro, Tempesta di Mare, Philomel, the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. There are also choruses such as the Philadelphia Singers, Mendelssohn Club, and Choral Arts Society, as well as those in local churches. There \'s the Cultural Alliance and the many educational institutions. It \'s my hope that the Bach Festival can bring them all together under one umbrella.  With the focus of the 2006-07 season of the Bach Festival on the master \'s choral works, both Jonathan Sternberg and Guido Houben are looking forward to audiences coming into Philadelphia from not just all around the region but from all across the country for two weekends and the evenings in between of the finest musicians playing the finest music.

Financial Consolidation The 30 Anniversary Season has been a successful one in financial terms, too. The major goals have been fulfilled: broadening the donor base, cutting overhead costs, and reducing liabilities. Building strength through information as our partners, the Cultural Alliance, the PA Council on the Arts, the Pew Charitable Trusts and the William Penn Foundation have taught us through the PA Cultural Data Project, we provided our stakeholders with as much information as possible. And thus, the season started with a bang: After having read the 29th season  Bach to the Future  annual report, Peter Benoliel decided to eliminate the Bach Festival \'s decade old debt to its former ensemble in residence, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia and sent in a check of  6,163. This very generous donation benefiting two Philadelphia musical institutions was an enormous motivation to further reduce the remaining debt. A world of thanks to Peter Benoliel for giving Bach to the community!

In this spirit, everyone purchasing a ticket online through our California-based ticket service at http://bach-fest.tix.com was also invited to contribute to the 30-4-30 campaign and make a  30 donation for the 30th Anniversary season. We also invited visitors of our website to join the 30-4-30 campaign to make a donation online at our account with www.Guidestar.org. As you can see from the list of supporters on the last page of this report, the campaign was quite successful. Overall, the Bach Festival maintained a diverse revenue structure from grants, donations, program book ads, and ticket revenues (see the following table for details).  - 18 -    Financial Statements Income  Income Ticket Income Grants Government Corporations Foundations Total Grants Donations Board Individuals Contributed Property/Supplies Total Donations Program Ads etc. Total Income Expense Program Expenses Production Expenses Promotions Expenses Total Program Expenses Admistrative Expenses Administrative Expenses Payroll Expenses Salaries and Wages Contractual Services Total Admistrative Expenses Total Fundraising Events Total Expense Net Income 8,103 4,987 16,167 2,091 31,348 1,731 96,658 11,065 53,233 10,346 63,579 15,230 26,739 1,731 42,700 6,009 108,975 13,723 3,200 16,000 32,423 In US-  26,592  Balance  ASSETS Checking/Savings Accounts Receivable Prepaid Expenses Equipment Total Assets LIABILITIES & EQUITY Liabilities Deferred Income Line of Credit Total Liabilities Equity Net Assets unrestricted Net Income Total Equity TOTAL LIABILITIES & EQUITY -13,477 11,065 -2,412 8,814 700 10,525 11,225 In US-  2,150 5,226 1,438 0 8,814  Cash Flow  OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net Income Adjustments to reconcile Net Income Accounts Receivable Prepaid Expenses Accrued liabilities Accrued liabilities: Chamber Orch.

It was founded as the ‚ÄòBasically Bach Festival‚Äô in 1976 by Michael Korn and committed members of the Chestnut Hill community (like Chorus America and the Philadelphia Singers). Until 1988, the Philadelphia Singers and the Concerto Soloists (today Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia) were the Festival‚Äôs ensembles in residence. Over the years many high profile artists from all over the world have enriched the cultural life of the Delaware Valley area through the Bach Festival of Philadelphia, artists such as the St. Thomas Boys Choir, Marie-Claire Alain, Julianne Baird, Paul Galbraith, Marietta Simpson, Anner Bylsma, Gustav Leonhardt, Todd Wilson, Joshua Rifkins, Ralph Kirkpatrick, David Finckel, Gary Kendall, The Swingle Singers, Helmuth Rilling, The Washington Bach Consort, Dresdner Kreuzchor, Richard Alexander, Jon Humphrey, The Bach Choir of Bethlehem, Ensemble Corund, Florilegium of London, Lionel Rogg, The New York Dance Company, Ullrich B√∂hme, The New York Chamber Soloists, Aulos Ensemble, Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, Ton Koopman, The Smithsonian Chamber Players and Chorus, Musica Antiqua K√∂ln, The Modern Jazz Quartet, John Gibbons, Les Arts Florissants, I Solisti Veneti, Alan Harler, Benita Valente, the Tallis Scholars, Jeffrey Brillhart, Michael Marissen, and Christoph Wolff. For extended information on the Bach Festival‚Äôs history,	see former President Martin Heckscher‚Äôs foreword to ‚Äú Universal Bach ‚Äù or click here . Mission The Bach Festival‚Äôs mission is Quality-Engagement-Opportunities-Relations We are committed: to organizing outstanding musical events in Philadelphia with internationally-renowned artists and young talents from the area; to engaging the local communities of Philadelphia in music and art related activities; to increasing business opportunities and tourism for the area; and to improving German-American relations by cooperating with the Bach-Fest Leipzig and other German organizations. Educational Outreach The Bach Festival vividly engages in education activities. The Bach Festival donates 10% of its tickets for every regular concert to schoolchildren and classes. If you are interested in obtaining these tickets please contact StringsForSchools.org . The annual Mr. Bach‚Äôs Birthday Party allows many children and their families to playfully get acquainted with Bach‚Äôs music. The ‚ÄúBach to School‚Äù programs we presented have been a great success with the schools involved. These are Philadelphia High School students rehearsing Bach‚Äôs Cantata 34 under the leadership of Greg Funfgeld, artistic director of the Bach Choir of Bethlehem. This program and others like it have been sponsored by The Bach Festival of Philadelphia. Here the students are giving their performance at the High School of Creative and Performing Arts in Philadelphia.These programs are vital in introducing Bach to children who might not otherwise have exposure to the great master. Activities such as these are expensive so if you are interested in helping sponsor them, please contact us or make a donation here .

Bach assuming his most important musical post in the city of Leipzig, from which an outstanding collection of works emerged. This concert includes his audition pieces - Cantatas #22 and #23 - alongwith Cantata 75 ‚Äú Die Elenden sollen essen ‚Äù and the famous chorale from Cantata 147 ‚ÄúJesu, Joy of Man‚Äôs Desiring‚Äù. Johann Kuhnau, Cantor and Director of Music in Leipzig, died in 1722. The city council then put in motion the search for a suitable successor. Although Johann Sebastian Bach, the court Capellmeister in C√∂then, was not the first choice ‚Äì Telemann and Graupner were the preferred successive candidates who, for various reasons, declined the position ‚Äì he became Thomaskantor and Director musices in Leipzig in May 1723. Before the city council made their decision Bach was required to visit Leipzig and perform two audition cantatas. Tonight‚Äôs concert juxtaposes these two trial cantatas with the first cantata Bach composed and performed after his appointment as Kuhnau‚Äôs successor. Cantatas 22 and 23 comprise the music of Bach that persuaded the Leipzigers to invite him to their city to compose and direct their ecclesiastical and civic music. Cantata 75 was in many respects Bach‚Äôs response to the people of Leipzig who had appointed him and was intended to convince them that they had made the right choice. The two trial cantatas were presented on 7 February 1723 on the Sunday known as Estomihi, the Sunday before Lent, and both were heard as part of the Eucharistic liturgy in the St. Thomas church. If for some reason Bach had been prevented from presenting his trial pieces on this Sunday he would have had to have waited almost two months for the next opportunity, sometime during the Easter season, since in Leipzig there was no concerted music in the Sunday worship of the churches during Lent. The Gospel for the day, Luke 18: 31-43, records two incidents that took place in Jericho. First, Jesus takes the twelve disciples aside and tells them that they are going to Jerusalem, where he would be arrested, tried and executed. It therefore serves as an introduction to the themes of Lent and Holy Week. Second, Jesus and the disciples set out for Jerusalem, and as they pass by a blind man calls out from the crowd: ‚ÄúJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.‚Äù Bach offers musical reflections on these two incidents in his trial cantatas. Cantata 22 Jesu nahm zu sich die Zw√∂lfe That this was a trial cantata is confirmed by one of Bach‚Äôs copyists, Johann Andreas Kuhnau ‚Äì nephew of Bach‚Äôs predecessor Johann Kuhnau ‚Äì who inscribed on the score: ‚ÄúThis is the Leipzig trial piece.‚Äù The author of the libretto is unknown, but since there is a close relationship between it and the two libretti of the first cantatas Bach composed after becoming Thomaskantor (BWV 75 and 76) ‚Äì and also with the two cantatas Graupner performed in Leipzig on 17 January, 1723, as his audition for the position ‚Äì it seems highly likely that same local Leipzig poet wrote the libretti of all these cantatas, as well as the first three movements of Bach‚Äôs Cantata 23. Estomihi was celebrated as a kind of Passion Sunday, since the Gospel of the day signaled the subject matter of the Sundays in Lent, leading to Holy Week and Good Friday. Thus Bach makes an allusion to Passion-music in the opening movement of Cantata 22. This Passion connection also explains the generally restrained nature of the cantata as a whole and its simple orchestration of strings and oboe. The first movement is a setting of the opening words of the Gospel of the day which are treated like a Passion, in the sense that it is divided between the evangelist (Tenor), Jesus (Bass), and disciples (Chorus). The movement is held together by the repeated ritornello, heard at different pitches, over a walking bass, an evocation of the journey to Jerusalem. The somewhat light-hearted choral fugue (marked Allegro ) at the end of the movement contrasts with the gravity of the setting of the words of Jesus, illustrating the explanation in the Gospel that the disciples did not understand what Jesus had said to them. The following aria (movt. 2), a trio for alto, oboe and continuo in a free da capo form, is a poignant declaration of intent to follow Jesus to Jerusalem ‚Äì in the form of a prayer ‚Äì articulating on behalf of the attending congregation that, in contrast to the twelve, the reason for the journey is now clearly understood. The ensuing accompanied Bass recitative (movt. 3) draws a contrast between the glory of the mount of transfiguration and the humiliation of the hill of crucifixion. Tabor, the transfiguration mount, is described as ‚Äúeine feste Burg,‚Äù so Bach makes a melodic allusion to Luther‚Äôs chorale melody ‚ÄúA mighty fortress.‚Äù Movement 4 is another free da capo aria in a lilting 3/8. The character of the piece reminds us that these trial cantatas were composed in C√∂then where Bach had been experimenting with various dance forms. Here the musical exposition stresses the ‚Äúewiges Gut‚Äù (eternal good), ‚ÄúFreude‚Äù (joy), and ‚ÄúFriede‚Äù (peace) that comes by dying to the world. The concluding movement is an extended chorale over a walking bass that recalls the insistent journeying of the first movement, the final stanza of Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn by Elisabeth Creutziger (1524). Cantata 23 Du Wahrer Gott Und Davids Sohn In the service on 7 February 1723 Cantata 22 was heard before the sermon, after the chanting of the Gospel. Later in the same service, during the distribution of communion, Bach‚Äôs second trial cantata was presented (musica sub communionem). In Lutheran worship the Agnus Dei, either in Latin or German, was customarily sung at communion. Cantata 23 therefore makes appropriate and significant use of the German Agnus Dei, Christe, du Lamm Gottes. Since it was performed later in the service the cantata does not begin with a chorus but rather a duet for Soprano and Alto, a long and poignant prayer for mercy that is linked both to the blind man‚Äôs cry for mercy in the Gospel for the day and to the liturgical prayer for mercy, the Agnus Dei. ‚ÄúThou, very God and David‚Äôs Son,‚Äù recalls the cry of the blind man: ‚ÄúSon of David, have mercy on me.‚Äù There are multi-levels of meaning here. The Lutheran understanding of the unique two natures of Christ, ‚Äútrue God and true man,‚Äù is given musical form. But at the same time the duet is set within the Trinitarian context of two oboes d‚Äôamore and continuo, with triplets occurring in all the parts. It is the two oboes d‚Äôamore that set the tone of the cantata right from the first measure, with their dark, somber sound. At that time the oboe d‚Äôamore was a new instrument, introduced by Leipzig instrument makers just a few years earlier. Thus Bach‚Äôs choice may reflect his concern to recognize this new ‚ÄúLeipzig‚Äù instrument, and thus commend himself to his would-be employers. But since the mezzo-soprano instrument was more suited for solo and obbligato use, whereas the standard oboe was essentially an ensemble instrument, together with Bach‚Äôs extensive use of the instrument later in Leipzig, his choice of two oboes d‚Äôamore here was more likely primarily conditioned by the texture and timbre of their combined sound. In the following recitative (movt. 2) there is a profound conjunction of parallel ideas, one verbal and the other non-verbal. The text is based on the words of wrestling Jacob in Genesis 32:26: ‚ÄúI will not let you go until you bless me.‚Äù Here the Tenor expresses the request to the Savior not to leave without imparting a blessing. The non-verbal parallel thought is expressed by the unison oboes and first violins who together play, in augmentation, the first melodic line of the German Agnus Dei, Christe, du Lamm Gottes, der tr√§gst die S√ºnd‚Äô der Welt, erbarm dich unser. With this text-less use of the German Agnus Dei Bach particularizes the desire for health and salvation expressed in the recitative. The third movement, a chorus in rondo form, begins with the words of Psalm 145:15: ‚ÄúThe eyes of all look to you, O Lord, and you give them their meat in due season,‚Äù frequently expounded Eucharistically in homiletic and devotional literature: God feeds the faithful with the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Significantly it is built upon a recurring bass line that follows the contours of the opening melodic phrase of Christe, du Lamm Gottes. The original autograph score includes only these first three movements and the words ‚ÄúIl-Fine‚Äù are entered at the end of the manuscript. However, the parts indicate that for the Leipzig trial Bach added a fourth movement, presumably only a matter of days before its performance in the St. Thomas church. In the same way that Graupner had extended the submitted libretto of his trial cantata by repetition, so Bach modified the libretto submitted to him by addition. This concluding chorale movement however was almost certainly not newly-composed; instead it seems that Bach used a movement he had written some ten years or so earlier in Weimar. On Good Friday, 26 March 1717, Bach presented a Passion in the court chapel in Gotha. The Capellmeister, Friedrich Witt was fatally ill and Bach, Court Concert master and organist of nearby Weimar was called in for the Good Friday performance. The court records document that he received a fee for his services and that ‚Äú20 bound [text] booklets for the Passion to be performed this year were delivered to the princely chapel.‚Äù No copies of these printed libretti have survived. It is assumed that Bach either composed a Passion, or, more likely, created a pastiche of movements by various composers, including himself. Therefore this movement is thought to have been part of his contributions to this Gotha Passion. In the previous movements of the cantata the Christe, du Lamm Gottes melody is only heard from within the orchestral accompaniment; now the complete German Agnus Dei, both text and melody, is given an explicit setting at the end of the cantata. Each time the basic melody of the liturgical prayer is heard it is given a different musical treatment. The first is a slow, homophonic choral section. The second time the melody is heard the tempo changes to Andante and the mood becomes more confident in a cantus firmus setting where the melody appears in a three-voice canon (Soprano, oboes, and violin I). The third and final petition of the German Agnus Dei the melody is heard in the Soprano, phrase by phrase, with some imitative counterpoint in the lower voice parts and an independent oboe above. The lack of tension at the end of the German Agnus Dei underlines the prayer for peace: ‚Äúgieb uns deinen Frieden‚Äù (grant us thy peace) . Taken together the nine movements of these two cantatas display a variety of forms: a chorus, an arioso with chorus, two different arias, a duet, accompanied recitatives, a straightforward setting of a chorale and an extended chorale setting with each section being interpreted differently. Here is music of extraordinary intensity and inventiveness that clearly impressed the Leipzig city councillors to appoint the C√∂then Capellmeister as their Cantor and Director of Music in 1723. To remind them of their decision, Bach repeated the two cantatas on Estomihi the following year (1724). Cantata 75 Die Elende sollen essen At the end of May 1723 Bach took up his duties and presented his first official cantata as the newly-appointed Cantor and Director of Music. In the Acta Lipsiensium academica the following report was published: ‚ÄúOn the 30th of the same [May], the First Sunday after Trinity, the new Cantor and Director of the Collegium Musicum [a mistake for Chori Musici ] Herr Johann Sebastian Bach, who has come here from the princely court at C√∂then, performed his first music with good applause [= approbation rather than clapping].‚Äù For his audition in February Bach had presented Cantatas 22 and 23, one before the sermon and the other during communion. For his first official Sunday he composed a single two-part cantata, rather than two cantatas. Thus Cantata 75 ‚Äì as well as Cantata 76 composed for the following Sunday (Trinity 2) ‚Äì is an extended work of fourteen movements, arranged in two groups of seven, with the same chorale setting ending each part (each with a different text). The original score of Cantata 75 is almost fair-copy throughout, reflecting the comparative leisure of four weeks or so between Bach‚Äôs appointment and the first Sunday on which he assumed his new duties. The Gospel for Trinity 1 was Luke 16: 19-31, the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. The opening movement of the first part of Cantata 75 is therefore rather somber, though masterly in effect. It has a complex bipartite structure, reminiscent of a French overture, with its solemn ‚Äúprelude‚Äù followed by an energetic fugue, unified by the instrumental ritornello. Following the Bass recitative, expounding the theme of the impermanence of riches, ‚Äúpurple that fades‚Äù (movt. 2), the Tenor da capo aria (movt. 3) is a dance-like celebration of the purple that (by implication) does not fade, that is the blood of Christ. Another recitative (Tenor, movt 4) reflects on a Magnificat-like theme of casting down and raising up, and leads to a Soprano da capo aria with oboe d‚Äôamore obbligato. It is not without significance that Bach calls for the ‚ÄúLeipzig‚Äù instrument again, the oboe d‚Äôamore, for this his first official cantata, an instrument he had specifically used in his trial cantata (Cantata 23) heard some three months earlier. The Soprano sings, in a lilting 3/8, ‚ÄúI take my sorrow with joy,‚Äù with joy (‚ÄúFreuden‚Äù) the keynote that is given a four-measure florid embellishment. Another secco recitative (Soprano, movt. 6) leads to the chorale that ends the first part of the cantata, stanza 7 of Samuel Rodigast‚Äôs Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan (1674) with its associated melody. It is an extended setting in which the chorale melody is presented line by line, over a confident walking bass, in a four-part vocal setting that is framed, accompanied and separated by an independent orchestral accompaniment that is related to the chorale melody. Bach reminds the congregation that the two parts of the cantata are connected by basing the Sinfonia that opens Part 2 (movt. 8) on the same chorale melody that closes Part 1, here given to a solo trumpet. An Alto recitative (movt. 9), focusing on spiritual poverty, leads to an Alto aria in a modified da capo form (movt. 10), a meditation on spiritual riches. Again, it is in a dance-like (quasi-passepied) lilting 3/8 with obbligato upper strings. A Bass recitative exhorts the exercise of faith (movt. 11) and leads into a Bass aria (movt. 12), an assertion of faith inflamed by the love of Christ, depicted by the accompanying obbligato trumpet. Following the final Tenor recitative, a reflection on the ‚Äúpoverty that no riches can equal‚Äù (movt. 13), the cantata ends with a repeat of the chorale setting that concludes Part 1, but with stanza 14 of Rodigast‚Äôs hymn. Alfred D√ºrr‚Äôs reflecting on the reception of this cantata by the Leipzigers in 1723 writes: ‚ÄúWhoever was capable of listening with insight could learn decisive things about the new Thomascantor . . . a forward-looking musician, not afraid to incorporate new, even fashionable elements in his composition, not as alien features but as purposeful components within the fundamental structure of the work.‚Äù 1 To which we should add that today we can still learn such ‚Äúdecisive things‚Äù when hearing these Leipzig cantatas of 1723.

His music has received wide exposure on WGBH radio in Boston and WNYC in New York City. His orchestral and chamber works have been played and recorded by international organizations including the Czech Radio Symphony orchestra, the Moravian Philharmonic and Salem Philharmonic, among others. Writing in Fanfare, William Zagorski termed his English Horn Concerto ‚Äú‚Ä¶a tonal and unabashedly lyrical concerto, resulting in a piece that is able to stand beside Richard Strauss‚Äôs and Ralph Vaughan Williams‚Äôs essays for oboe and orchestra.‚Äù He has received numerous commissions, from the Aiolos Collective, an international group of wind players, to the Martinu String Quartet of Prague. Variations and Fugue on a Bach-Busoni Chorale was commissioned for Simone Dinnerstein by John Boyce. David Post‚Äôs scores are published by MMC Music, Inc., St. Louis MO. MMC Recordings, Turquoise Bee Productions and West Virginia University Sound Recordings, Inc. produce his commercial CDs. Composer of skilled and hauntingly beautiful music, Philip Lasser has crafted a unique soundworld blending the subtle colors of French Impressionist sonorities with the crisp, direct sounds and rhythms of America‚Äôs jaunty musical palette. Philip Lasser seeks content over form, expression over syle. Standing apart from the modernist trends and experiments, Philip Lasser has devoted himself to the timeless search for personal expression through his highly refined muscial voice. Philip Lasser Performers such as Elizabeth Futral, Margo Garrett, Cho-Liang Lin, Simone Dinnerstein, Zuill Bailey and Giora Schmidt, as well as recent Marguerite Long gold medalist, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Neuburger perform Lasser‚Äôs works regularly.

But the view of Telemann as a mere Vielschreiber, a polygraph, has changed, and now he is acknowledged not only as one of the most gifted musical personalities of the eightteenth century but also as an important figure in the development of western music - even though, amazingly, he was (apart from fourteen difficult days of keyborard lessons from an organist) self-taught as a composer, multi-instrumentalist, writer, singer and poet. Johann Mattheson stated in his Grundlage einer Ehren-pforte (Hamburg 1740): Ein Lully wird ger√ºhmt; Corelli l√§sst sich loben, nur Telemann allein ist √ºber \'s Lob erhoben (A Lully becomes famous, a Corelli attracts praise; only Telemann is raised above all adoration) This judgement presents the usual mid-eighteenth-century German view: Lully and Corelli canonised as personifying the French and Italian styles, and Telemann as the leading German composer in a new, heterogeneous style that was increasingly regarded as being of a higher order. The concerto a camera is a result of this mixed style. Telemanns collection Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst, published in Hamburg in 1726, was the first complete set of cantatas for the liturgical year to be published. The 72 cantatas are designated for voice, an obligato instrument (recorder, violin, transverse flute or oboe) and basso continuo. In 1731-32 he published Fortsetzung des Harmonischen Gottes-Dienstes, using two obligato instruments. Although intended for worship, both public and private, Telemann \'s cantatas are a masterly blend of tunefulness with skilled counterpoint and vocal and instrumental virtuosity. As a young composer Telemann studied the Italian, French and German styles of counterpoint. In his Corellisierende sonata and in Quadro the italian style is dominant. Georg von Bertouch (1668-1743) was a man of action, quite literally: he took part in no fewer than 22 battles, and ended his career as a commandant of Akershus Castle, which still overlooks the harbour in Oslo. But Bertouch, a German-born Norwegian, was also a well-known musician, corresponding with Johann Sebastinan Bach and Johann Mattheson. The manuscript containing Bertouch \'s XXIV Sonates compos√©es par les canons, fuges, contre points (...) in all 24 keys is preserved in the Royal Library in Copenhagen. It is dated 1738, the first six sonantas are missing. Bertouch may well have had the idea for a collection using all the keys from Bachs Wohltemperierte Klavier (1722). Bertoch wrote a letter to Bach in 1738, and may have enclosed a copy of the manuscript. Bergen Barokk was founded in 1994 and is now one of the leading baroque ensembles in Scandinavia. Concerts in Scandinavia, USA and Russia. Bergen Barokks repertoire consists of 17th and 18th Century vocal and instrumental music from Italy, France, Germany, England and Scandinavia. Bergen Barokk recorded italian baroque sonatas on Simax Classics (Oslo), English Cantatas on BIS (Stockholm) and German baroque on Toccata Classics (London). In the period 2006-09 Bergen Barokk will publish a first complete recording of Telemanns Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst. Bergen Barokk is supported by the City of Bergen, the University of Bergen and Norwegian Culture Council. FRANZ VITZTHUM received his initial musical training as a member of the Regensburger Domspatzen. His later studies took him first to Munich, where he was a pupil of Gabriele Kaiser and Florian Mayr, and subsequently to Cologne, where he has been working with Kai Wessel at the city \'s Music College since October 2001.

The music, much of it based on baroque dance, is among the best ever written, and requires an orchestra of one - a violinist - which is great for the cash-strapped modern-dance world. However, Philadelphia-based Lisa Kraus turned a good idea into a rich and substantial one this weekend with The Partita Project. Speaking more as a music lover than as a dance aficionado, I refuse to believe it won \'t have a further life. The music itself takes up the challenge of making the fundamentally monophonic violin a complete entity unto itself. Strings are played simultaneously; welters of notes sketch broadly imagined monuments of architecture in sound. Not straitjacketed to Bach, Kraus (a Trisha Brown alumna who reviews dance for The Inquirer) collaborated with violinist Diane Monroe, who plays Bach well as written but can extemporize in jazz style - a conceptual plus in the post-postmodern world that Kraus effortlessly inhabits. The performance space at the Meeting House Theater on Lancaster Avenue was a plain room with bleacher-style seats, the only set design being a series of small chandeliers all hung at diagonal angles, some dripping with strings of cut glass that alternately resembled ice and cobwebs, reminiscent of the surrealist director Richard Foreman and fitting the kinds of twists the piece would give to music made 280-plus years ago. The dance, created for a core company of five, had its basis in classical ballet, though extended in both chronological directions, backward to the world of baroque dance with its formal, prescribed geometric floor plans, and forward to a more free-form, philosophically barefoot style. All was fused with almost casual ease by the improvisatory air of the performance, which played off the sequential building blocks that dominate the music \'s surface. The summit of the piece was inevitably the  Ciaccona,  Bach \'s tour de force of musical invention based on the same, rigorously repeated progression of eight chords. Here, Kraus went for the wider choreographic possibilities of subtext, stopping the music at times for dance-only passages and vice versa. Repeatedly, there were images suggesting rescue from quicksand, with dancers trying to bridge dangerous gaps, ending with only one left standing. The central tragedy of Bach \'s life came to mind the abrupt death of his beloved first wife. In the talk-back session after the Sunday performance, Kraus confirmed that it was part of her thinking.  file://C: \\Documents and Settings \\Ted \\Desktop \\Five dancers, one violin and Bach Great id... 11/15/2006    Five dancers, one violin and Bach: Great idea  Page 2 of 2  So much of The Partita Project was so fully realized, you had to be puzzled when it jumped the track, first with a dance lecture of sorts presented performance-art style, with angular movements and explosive delivery (why?), and, in the final third, a Bach-less interlude with a game of musical chairs. That seemed to claim profundity for something mundane (double why?). With the wrong audience, that could hijack the piece. What a loss that would be.

Expected, and wonderful. Not long after, there \'s an unexpected and strange vista to the left: crumbling cement retaining walls backed by vivid green fields, and beyond, gray towers angling against a blue sky. Downtown Philadelphia, glinting in the light and looking for all the world like Oz. At such a sight, the spirit quickens, as it did on my last trip into the City of    Brotherly Love. I was off to see  The Partita Project;  and in this work by Lisa Kraus I encountered courage, heart, brain, and beauty, too. Lisa Kraus began dancing at the age of six with Jane Dudley, a former Martha Graham dancer, and then took classes at the Graham school, and at the Merce Cunningham studio. At summer camp, she danced with the fabled James Waring. At Bennington, she studied with Judith Dunn and Steve Paxton, and on graduating moved to new York and joined the Trisha Brown Dance Company, where for six years she absorbed the repertory and created roles in three works. (Recently, she set one of these--the wonderful dance called  Glacial Decoy ≠on the Paris Opera Ballet. I was lucky enough to see it, and it was beautiful, and true.) She then appeared with other choreographers, and founded a company of her own. Each of her dancers from that era is now a well known choreographer: John Jasperse, Meg Stuart, and Sasha Waltz. (You might want to keep your eye on the dancers in The Partita Project -- I certainly will -- because Kraus has a clear track record here.)  Out of all this history, you can see most clearly the Trisha in the Lisa: the dissolves, the cantilevering, the partial falls, the retrograde recoveries, and the call and response from one body part to another, and one dancer to another; and, too, the wit. However, she takes that style and carries it someplace else -- back, if you will, to the future. For where Brown would leave a phrase unfinished, in that loopy and ineffable way of hers that makes everything vanish, Kraus offers completion, just as Bach does. However long her phrases, they have real endings. There is a poetry in this. Her forms are elastic, but they are indeed forms. An arm may waft out propelled by a force that travels up from the opposite leg, but it doesn \'t drop; the movement doesn \'t deplete itself, because it    isn \'t traveling on a finite energy supply. Rather, it gathers itself in and recovers that energy, the way a line of poetry does when it comes to a full stop, no matter how it has meandered, and no matter what the terminal punctuation, or even implied punctuation. In 2000, after working at Naropa in Colorado, and then spending a decade in The Netherlands at the European Dance Development Center, Kraus returned to the United States, and began working first in hospice and later in elder care, leading recreational activities. Though these activities are not evident in any overt content in her work, she has written that  these experiences marked me by dissolving a notion I \'d long held≠that with my `elitist \' orientation to dance, that is, always being preoccupied with non-mainstream ideas and continuing on from the line of the Judson Church experimentalists, what I do could never be compelling for a group of people who knew nothing about those things. Not true. Reading the newspaper became theater. Looking someone straight in the eye and listening to them became the most precious thing I could do.  This part of her experience is indeed evident in her current work. The Partita Project opens with a long solo for Kraus, who is seated in the center of a room lit by lovely neo-classical chandeliers designed by Michael Biello, who cantilevers and tilts them over a rectangular performing space. Along the front, there are tiers of seats. To the sides, rows of chairs seat the dancers when they are off stage, and more onlookers. The effect is intimate, as at a private concert. Stage center, a chair with a lyre back≠nothing extraneous in this detail, as it echoes the Rilke text that will be Kraus \'s script≠sits on a small oriental carpet. Kraus is gently and gracefully collapsed there, seated on the rug with her head cradled on her arms on the seat of the chair. She is a study in white and taupe silk, and white skin and taupe-ish curls, her feet shod in charming suede court shoes that look touchingly worn. Her red lipstick is not only a spot of color, it is a spot of drama. Her simple tank top and trousers seem timeless, and so, too, does she. She is playing a character who is herself, but also somehow someone other. There \'s something reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty about her, and even more of the girl in  Spectre de la Rose.  Timeless, and artful, yet artless. She begins to speak, saying  Eyes shut. Eyes open.  Then she begins whispering, in German, from Rilke \'s  Sonnets to Orpheus.  Her monologue morphs into movement -- a ballerina remembering what it was to    perform; and thence into a lecture about Bach and his partitas. Somehow, she is not only telling about the composer, but evoking someone important to him, one feels. She is a narrator, and she is also a player, a participant, a figure out of some inner vision and apprehension about Bach \'s life at the time he composed the music that soon will fill the room.  Double and redouble; point and counterpoint; part and counterpart; layer on layer; past and present convergent: this Kraus \'s choreographed response to the violin partitas of Johann Sebastian Bach. In performance, these are played, and riffed on, by the violinist Diane Monroe, whose musical activities range from traditional to contemporary, and include original and improvised works. (Like Kraus, she is currently on the faculty of Swarthmore College, and pursues a crowded performing schedule. Her web site, should you want to learn more about her work, is www.monroesbow.com.) For  The Partita Project,  Monroe combines her pellucid classical line with her jazz artistry, responding to the music as she plays it, and also responding to the music as the dancers embody it. The entire construct is like a conversation: layered dialogues. Bach and Kraus, Monroe and Bach, Monroe and Kraus, and also, in sympathetic response,  The Partita Project  and its audience. There is a cumulative sense of all this as the music and dance build together, deeply winding us into their twined architectures. A total sense of something complex and wonderful and real, yet utterly ephemeral. Poignant then, the way dance is. The way life is. Kraus did not choreograph the work with Monroe. It was made first, to the Bach alone. In following the deep structures of his music, she has found the way to wind    back the choreographic clock but keep her identity intact. You see the Brownian, and, if you will, the Bacchante. You see the structures of court dancing, with a bow to the square dance that would later evolve from it. (This might remind you, in passing, of Balanchine \'s similar connecting of the baroque and the country, in his  Square Dance,  to Vivaldi and Corelli). Kraus has effectively become a time traveler, transporting herself back to the day in which Bach made this music -- and made it to be danced to. Her fidelity is itself courteous in the deepest sense, and courtly, yet contemporary. Her response is also emotional and heart-felt≠or so one feels with one \'s own heart, watching this work transpire over about an hour, in harmonious correspondence to the music, with intimacy and whimsicality. Contemplative, yet spontaneous. Elastic, yet formal. And utterly attentive. Indeed, attentiveness might be the key attribute of  The Partita Project.  Dancers to dancers (there are four women and one man, wearing contemporary black and white costumes that evoke the baroque in glancing visual allusion); and, as stated, choreographer to composer, performer to choreographer, musician to composer and so forth. Most of all though, the attentiveness of Lisa Kraus to J.S. Bach -- to his music, the time in his life at which he wrote it, to the state of mind you can intuit in listening. In wonderful complement, you meet Bach in this dance, and Kraus in this music. Sometimes their counterpoint is implied, with Kraus weaving her dance over or under the continuous line of the music. Thus, for instance, she follows a long phrase in the Chaconne by twining her dancers over the musical phrase in fluid progression, so that the movement, while passing from one to the next, does not end until Bach \'s phrase does. In other words, two or three or four or five dancers may perform a single musical line, as relay runners run a single race, passing the baton one to the next. That is perhaps the most invisible of the Kraus structural correspondences to the Bach. At other times, as one note \'s resonance joins the next note played and then both join the next note still, until three notes hang together in the air as a single chord, the dancers respond in kind, joining in trio. Then as the dancers jointly embody the architecture of an arpeggio, Monroe reiterates the chord in exultant declamation, first playing two notes together, and finally adding a triumphant third    note. The airs filled with resonance, as does the ear. And the mind. You also see canon, fugue, and the constant or near-constant variation in the number of voices, which here are not voices but dancers. Sometimes they dance singly but in unison; sometimes they dance separately but together, because they are hearing the same music; sometimes two take up one voice, and three another. They are Meg Foley, Jaamil Kosoko, Melissa Putz, RenÈe Robinson-Buzby, and Josie Smith. They perform as themselves; there is no acting in this dance; and yet, they convey a dancerly narrative that builds as the music winds its way into the Chaconne and through dances called Preludio, Sarabande Double, Gigue, and Party Game. (This last is a game of musical chairs, entirely spontaneous.) At one moment, one dancer sits in air, making her body into a chair; another reclines on her, and then another, with her arms reaching forward. Reclining back, reaching forward. That is the movement in this piece, and its overarching construction. It ends with another doubling, as one of her dancers settles into repose just as Kraus was settled at the beginning.  Here I am,  she seems to say.  I have been dancing in this piece all along. I dance as my dancers.  Sitting to one side, she has been watching along with us. A part of her dance, and a part of us, as well. Her unaffected and lucid presence, her lovely clearness, recalls contemporary descriptions of the Italian actress Eleanora Duse, who rather than paint her face with rouge, would actually blush. In other words, she not merely seemed real, she was real. Here is part of an entry on Duse from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. VII, that I will borrow here to evoke Kraus for you:  Her art depended on intense naturalness rather than on stage effect; sympathetic force or poignant intellectuality rather than...theatrical emotionalism.  The result of that is the same now, as then: real calls to real. We respond in kind.    Lisa Kraus plans to continue  The Partita Project  over the next two years, first presenting performances  in historic and alternative spaces,  and then in a repertory version with a consortium of Philadelphia area colleges. I would hope, too, to see this project take to the road, so that you might see it. Meanwhile, I \'ll be traveling back to Philadelphia. I \'ve been drawn inside this work, and I want to revisit the self I am when I am with it. Another doubling then. Part, and counterpart. This is one of the ways to dwell in possibility: to dwell in a work of art.  The photos are stills from a video by Carmella Vassor Johnson.

The famous Wedding Cantata ‚ÄúWeichet nur, betruebte Schatten‚Äù BWV 202 for soprano solo gives a fulminate start and refers to her competition repertoire. The following Viola Concerto in D (transcription of BWV 1053) will be performed by Costa Rican violist Edmundo Ramirez who most recently excelled with this work in Sao Paulo under the baton of Kent Nagano. The Concerto perfectly leads into Cantata ‚ÄúIch geh und suche mit Verlangen‚Äù BWV 49, since its third movement is identical with the opening sinfonia of the cantata. After the intermission Yulia van Doren will perform ‚ÄúTritt auf die Glaubensbahn‚Äù BWV 152 again for soprano and bass solo. As in Cantata 49, Franklin Phillips will sing the bass part. Cantata 152 will also feature baroque flutist Gwyn Roberts of Tempesta di Mare and Edmundo Ramirez with a viola d \'amore part.

By Guido Houben When Michael Korn and his friends started the  Basically Bach Festival  in 1976 with the Philadelphia Singers and with the Concerto Soloists (now known as the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia), the world looked quite different from today. Globalization had just begun and high speed communication and transportation modes didn \'t exist for the public at large. Philadelphia in particular looked different with no building standing taller than Billy Penn \'s hat atop City Hall. It was a forgotten city in de-industrializing decay, if it hadn \'t been for the movie  Rocky  and its vista from the Art Museum steps that came out the same year. In 1991, the city reappeared on the world scene when the movie  Philadelphia  got into the theaters and marked the beginning of it regaining attraction. Why mention movies? Because culture is what moves people, attracts them, and forms their identity. It is for its cultural products that the U.S. is regarded in the Americas and abroad (not for its wars). And today, if at all, Philadelphia is known for what Harvard economist Michael Porter would call a competitive cultural cluster: the Avenue of the Arts with the Orchestra and Kimmel Center as well as the Art Museum and Barnes Foundation, nurtured by a lot of underground hotbeds. These range from the gallery scene through the Fringe Festival to the Mural Arts Project. Are there ways to develop this cluster further to make Philadelphia globally competitive in the music sector? Here \'s a suggestion: think outside the city box, pool resources, and join forces! Coming out of some years of darkness after the separation from Michael Korn in 1988 and his premature death in 1991, the Bach Festival for its part is developing new shape and fame under its new leadership with Music and Artistic Director Jonathan Sternberg. This Spring, the Bach Festival Week spread out over the entire city with five major congregations joining forces. The idea was simple: instead of performing one Bach cantata at some point of the year regardless, we agreed on splitting up his five masses among us, performing them all in liturgical settings for the first time ever, and concentrating the services in a ten-day period over two weekends. The Bach Festival provided a common marketing umbrella and invited Prof. Christoph Wolff of Harvard University and the Bachfest Leipzig to give the project a uniting blessing with a lecture on the masses. The advantage was twofold: (1) the project integrated communities within the city, and (2) it provided much more attraction and visibility for visitors than a single event would have. Why Bach? The number of small Bach Festivals around the world and his record sales speak for themselves and established  JSB  as a truly global player. And at the Philadelphia Bach Festival, the opening service at the predominantly African-American Bright Hope Baptist Church was the most well attended one. While this might have come as a surprise to a Mainline audience, it shows that Johann Sebastian Bach \'s music is indeed universal and extremely suitable for a festival uniting people of different age groups and ethnic backgrounds. Thus, the Bach Festival Week 2005 was a first and important step towards creating a music festival of the level of Boston \'s Early Music Festival or the Oregon Bach Festival.    A next step to this new level is being launched by the Bach Festival right now: the  Bach 2 Phila Net Project  is an internet platform that integrates all Bach-related activities in Philadelphia in the 2005/06 season (see www.Bach-Fest.org/B2P-NP.htm). If you use this simple tool and join forces, it will be a success and benefiting all. In addition, the Festival Week from now on will always center around Bach \'s birthday on March 21. This will make it simple for other organizations to schedule their Bach activities at the same time in advance. If the city \'s administration, the Greater Philadelphia Tourism & Marketing Corporation, and private-public partnerships such as Innovation Philadelphia (ipphila.com) or the Arts & Business Council seize the opportunity to join and promote the events pool of the Festival Week 2006, the final step to reach a level of global competitiveness will have been taken. Afraid of scale? Unlike gigantic single events, pooled community events have the advantage of reaching global economies of scale while still preserving local coziness and charm. For such an example of the two diverging forces of  g-local-ization  at work we needn \'t look farther than the  mother of all  Bachfests in Leipzig. At the dawn of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia \'s 30th anniversary season, it is time to join forces in order to create a bigger appeal to visitors (some call it markets) near and far. The song remains the same, as Michael Korn \'s original concept in the 1970s, just on a larger scale: bundle the music events of several organizations at a particular time and with a particular theme to create a whole event bigger than the sum of its parts. Thus, we \'ll provide cross-fertilizing business opportunities (entertainment, dining, lodging etc.) and more people will be attracted to experience what this is all about: music, particularly the divine music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

There are specific charitable giving strategies that can make your gift or bequest more effective, and you can receive a financial benefit by helping others. If, at your death, the total value of everything you own - including real estate, investments, automobiles, retirement accounts, life insurance, personal possessions, etc. - exceeds the amount exempt from tax ( 1,000,000 in 2002 and 2003), your heirs will owe taxes ranging from approximately one-third to nearly one-half of your total estate. You may have already planned for this contingency by purchasing life insurance sufficient to cover any tax liability you believe your estate may owe. Or perhaps you \'ve implemented some estate planning, directing who will get which assets, and when. But regardless of any planning you may have done, the reality is if your total estate exceeds the amount exempt from tax, the IRS will claim its  share  of everything you own. After a lifetime of planning and saving, do you really want to be that generous to the IRS? There is another option, and if you \'re one of the many Americans who care about and support charitable institutions, it \'s an option that may be of interest to you. It \'s called Charitable Giving, and it \'s a strategy that can help you accomplish your charitable objectives, reduce the amount of estate taxes your heirs will owe, provide you or someone you name with a lifetime income, and, with proper planning, do so without reducing the amount of wealth you leave to your heirs.  1   What Is Charitable Giving?  Very simply, Charitable Giving is an estate planning strategy in which, by donating a portion of your assets to a recognized charity, church, educational institution, or other qualifying organization, you \'re able to accomplish two primary objectives:  Leave a Legacy ≠ You can achieve a very real desire to use your assets to benefit others. Your money may be directed to organizations such as hospitals, foundations, local charitable organizations, colleges or universities. In this manner, a Charitable Giving strategy can both directly and indirectly benefit family, friends and community.  Reduce/Eliminate Estate Taxes ≠ Instead of paying estate taxes to the government, wouldn \'t you prefer to choose how those dollars will be spent? By making the decision to gift assets directly to charitable organizations, you can use your assets to support charities and organizations that are important to you and your community. The important point to remember is that if your estate is subject to taxation at the time of your death, the taxes are going to be collected, and are going to be spent. The upside is that, in establishing a Charitable Giving strategy, you can decide in advance how it will be spent.  A Charitable Giving strategy can both directly and indirectly benefit family, friends and community.  2    A Charitable Giving strategy lets you determine how your money will be spent.  Who can benefit from a Charitable Giving strategy?  The most likely candidates for Charitable Giving are individuals who, first and foremost, want to remember a favorite charity with a tax-advantaged gift or bequest. Other candidates include people who want to:  Take an immediate income tax deduction, which can be applied against other sources of income; Reduce their estate tax liability; Provide themselves or others with additional lifetime income; Dispose of appreciated property without triggering capital gains tax consequences; Diversify their investment portfolio.       3  There are a number of ways to set up a Charitable Giving strategy. They range from the simple act of donating funds or property to a favorite charitable organization or naming them as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy, to accomplishing your charitable goals through the use of  split interest  trusts. One of the most common and popular ways to manage a Charitable Giving strategy is through the use of a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT).  3   What Is a CRT?  A CRT is a tax-advantaged, trust arrangement that can provide you with both immediate and lifetime benefits, and a charity that you select with future benefits. There are two beneficiaries of a CRT:  The  income beneficiary  is the person or persons (including yourself) who will benefit from the trust during the trust term. The charity will benefit from the trust after the end of the trust term.    The trust assets must be left to charity following the trust term. However, the charitable beneficiary receiving those assets can be changed at any time prior to death. And because the assets donated to a CRT are earmarked for a qualifying charity, the trust is tax-exempt. You \'ll pay no capital gains taxes when the asset is sold by the trust. For this reason, property you intend to donate to the trust should be transferred to the CRT prior to being sold. Property generally donated to CRTs include highly appreciated assets with low cost basis. For example:     Shares of stock Bonds Mutual funds Real estate Jewelry Fine art  4    What are the advantages of a CRT?  The advantages of establishing a CRT are many. With a CRT, you can:  Secure an immediate income tax deduction ≠ The amount of the deduction you may take is based on the net present value of the remainder interest that will pass, at the end of the trust term, to the charity. However, the IRS limits the deduction you can take in any given year to a percentage of your adjusted gross income for that year. For that reason, the IRS allows you to take your deduction, if necessary, over a period of up to six years. Reduce estate taxes ≠ Your estate receives an unlimited charitable estate tax deduction for the remainder interest that passes to charity. This decreases the amount of estate taxes your heirs will owe to the government. Eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of an appreciated asset ≠ When you sell an appreciated asset, you must pay capital gains taxes on the difference between its sales price and your original cost. This difference can be substantial when you \'re talking about assets that have been held over long periods of time. Assets that have been donated to a CRT, and then sold, are not subject to capital gains tax. Generate an income for yourself, your family, or anyone you choose, for life or for a specified period of time ≠ Once an asset has been donated to a CRT, the trustee can sell the asset (avoiding capital gains taxes) and purchase an investment vehicle that provides income. The CRT can be structured to pay this income to you (or someone you select) for life, or for a period of years (not to exceed 20 years). Diversify your investment portfolio ≠ Because assets in a CRT can be sold without triggering capital gains taxes, assets that are concentrated in one single market sector can be sold and spread among many sectors. For example, shares of a single company \'s stock could be sold with the proceeds being used to purchase mutual funds or a variable annuity.        5   How Does a CRT Work?  There are three basic kinds of CRTs, each with its own advantages. Which type of CRT is best for you will likely be determined by how you want income distributed to your income beneficiary.  Charitable Remainder Annuity Trusts (CRATs) ≠ A CRAT provides a guaranteed fixed income stream every year, and is ideal for individuals who require the security of an income payment that never changes. The payment is based on a fixed percentage (minimum of 5% percent) of the initial fair market value of the donated asset. For example, a CRAT with an initial value of  1 million dollars set up to generate a 7.5% payout would always pay  75,000 annually to the income beneficiary, regardless of how the underlying trust assets perform. The  75,000 must be paid, every year, even if the trust investments produce less than  75,000 of earnings. Likewise, if the underlying trust assets grow by more than 7.5% in any given year, the payment remains at  75,000 with any increase in value being passed on to the charity at the end of the trust term. Once a CRAT is established, no further contributions can be made. Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUTs) ≠ A CRUT provides an annual income payment that is based on a fixed percentage (minimum of 5%) of the trust \'s fair market value. The fair market value of the trust is determined on an annual basis. For that reason, income from a CRUT will vary from year to year, depending upon the performance of the underlying trust assets. Like CRATs, income must be paid to the income beneficiary every year, and trust principal may be invaded in order to make the required payment. Unlike CRATs, however, additional assets may be contributed to a CRUT after it has been established, providing a more flexible financial planning tool.    6    Net Income with Make-Up Charitable Remainder Trusts (NIMCRUTs) ≠ A NIMCRUT is the most flexible of CRTs. Like its CRUT cousin, a NIMCRUT provides an annual income payment that is based on a fixed percentage (again, minimum of 5%) of the trust \'s fair market value, which is determined on an annual basis. Like a CRUT, the income from a NIMCRUT will vary from year to year, depending upon the performance of the underlying trust assets. Where a NIMCRUT differs from both CRATs and CRUTs, however, is that should the net income of the trust in any given year be less than the required fixed income percentage, the trust may pay less than the established percentage, with the deficiency being made up in later years provided the trust income exceeds the required fixed income percentage amount ≠ also called the  make-up  provision. NIMCRUTs are best used by individuals who do not have an immediate need for income, and who like the idea of starting and stopping income, or timing it for when it is required.  Charitable Lead Trust  Charitable Lead Trusts or  CLT ≠ sometimes called Charitable Income Trusts ≠ essentially accomplish the opposite of Charitable Remainder Trusts. Charitable Lead Trusts are used when a donor wants to provide an income to a charitable organization for a period of time, but leave the  remainder  of the estate to his or her heirs at the end of the trust term. In such a case, the donor would put assets into a charitable trust, with the charity receiving an income for a period of time set forth in the trust document. At the end of that period, the principal passes to the noncharitable beneficiaries of the trust. A Charitable Lead Trust allows a donor to pass assets to his or her heirs at a discounted gift or estate tax value while providing for a favorite charity.  7     IRA Alternative  NIMCRUT  Donor, age 45, creates a NIMCRUT with specified income payments of 6% annually for life, and contributes  10,000 per year for 20 years. The NIMCRUT purchases an annuity, and the donor receives no income payments until age 65, at which time the donor ceases contributions, receives a lump-sum payment for the entire  make-up  amount, and receives 6% annual payments thereafter for life. Assuming the NIMCRUT assets earn 5% annually, donor lives to age 85, and the applicable interest rate for calculating the charitable deductions is 5%:      Total Contributions (20 years):  200,000 Total Income Tax Charitable Deductions:  57,066 Average Annual Charitable Deduction:  2,853 Lump-Sum  Make-Up  Amount at Age 65:  176,631* Total Retirement Income to Age 80:  688,515* Average Annual Retirement Income:  34,441 Total Benefits to Donor:  865,446 Tax-Free Charitable Contribution at Death:  877,338 Total Financial Benefits of NIMCRUT:  1,742,784  Benefits and Advantages    Income tax charitable deduction for portion of each contribution Income tax deferral for investment earnings and growth of trust assets Increased savings for college funding, retirement income, or other lifetime needs. Contribution flexibility - no maximum limits or other requirements Control over timing and amount of income payments No penalty taxes or distribution rules for income payments Substantial contribution for financial support of selected organizations  *Distributions would be taxable as ordinary income The above is for illustrative purpose only and does not represent any specific investment product. This should not be deemed a representation of past or future investment results as actual figures may be more or less than those shown. Annuities are subject to various fees and expenses. For more detailed information, please consult your financial professional.  In all three types of CRTs, trust assets are passed to the named organization at the death of the last income beneficiary or at the end of a stated trust period, which cannot exceed 20 years. The amount of trust assets that passes to the charity will, obviously, depend on several factors, including the size of the income percentage selected and the performance of the trust. The larger the income percentage (and the worse the performance), the smaller the remainder value will be for the charity at the end of the trust term. To accommodate the possibility that trust assets will vanish altogether before they are passed on to the charity, the CRT must meet certain guidelines:  8  The maximum payout percentage must be less than 50% of the trust \'s assets. There must be at least a 10% remainder to be passed on to charity.     What About Your Heirs?  Despite the tax, estate, and philanthropical advantages of Charitable Giving, many people feel a little apprehensive about giving an asset to charity that might otherwise be given to heirs. If such feelings have kept you from implementing a Charitable Giving strategy, you might want to consider a Wealth Replacement Trust in addition to a CRT.  CRT During Lifetime  Life Insurance Company Donor  Gives Cash Pays Life Insurance Premium  Buyer  W h a t is a Wealth R e p l a c e m e n t Trust?  A Wealth Replacement Trust is a completely separate entity from the CRT, and it utilizes life insurance with an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) to help you accomplish your charitable, tax and estate objectives, without having to reduce the amount of wealth you leave to your heirs. Essentially, income generated by the CRT (or the income tax savings that result from having established the CRT) are used to purchase a life insurance policy on the life of the donor with a face amount approximately equal to the value of the asset that is being left to charity. The life insurance policy is owned by the ILIT, which, in turn, keeps it out of the donor \'s estate. At the death of the donor, the life insurance proceeds are paid to the ILIT, free from income or estate taxes, and from there to the trust beneficiary(ies). In this way, assets can be left to charity, and their value  replaced  through the payment of the life insurance proceeds to your heirs eliminating the concern that your heirs will receive a reduction in inheritance.

Together we can help you determine a strategy that will best meet your goals and objectives. Your attorney should draft the trust to your specifications, and in accordance with federal and state laws.  Step two  Gift your appreciated asset to the CRT. Remember ≠ the gift is irrevocable. You will get an income tax deduction in the year of the gift, and possibly in subsequent years depending on the size of your gift and your adjusted gross income.  Step three  The trustee sells your gift, avoiding capital gains, and reinvests the proceeds in an annuity or other income-producing financial vehicle providing diversification, growth potential, and accessibility.  10    Your Financial Advisor can help you determine a strategy that will best meet your goals.  Step four  You and/or your named income beneficiary(ies) begin to receive income payments for life, or for a term of years, depending on how your CRT was drafted. If you \'ve elected to take advantage of a Wealth Replacement Trust, you can gift a portion of your income to fund a life insurance policy held within an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust.  Step five  At the end of the CRT term, the charity you have selected will receive the remainder of the assets in the CRT.  Step six  If you elected the Wealth Replacement Strategy, at your death the proceeds would be paid to the trust, free of income and estate taxes. The trustee could then distribute the proceeds of the policy to your trust beneficiaries - generally your heirs.  11   Putting It All Together  Charitable Giving can be an important component of any estate plan. When executed properly, Charitable Giving can help you provide an income to yourself or others, reduce your current and future tax liability, and help you remember a favorite charity. When combined with a Wealth Replacement Trust, it can also allow you to provide a legacy to your heirs.  The bottom line:  A secure financial future doesn \'t happen by accident. It requires examining your current circumstances, identifying your goals and objectives, developing a plan to achieve those goals and objectives, taking action to implement your plan, and periodically reviewing your plan. The tool that helps us gather the appropriate information to begin this planning process is referred to as a fact-finder - a series of questions specific to your unique situation. You can rest assured that all the information that you provide will remain strictly confidential. Once we have a good understanding of your current situation we will be better prepared to serve your needs, both now and in the future.  12    T h e Penn Mutual Family of Companies:    The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company The Penn Insurance and Annuity Company Independence Capital Management, Inc.

It was originally a producing organization, with The Philadelphia Singers and Concerto Soloists in residence. Led by Artistic Director Michael Korn, these ensembles presented several concer1s during one weekend in the fall. When the Festival expanded its season, it began to invite notable guest artists to perform. In 1984 the Bach Festival formed an in-school music outreach program in response to limited arts education opportunities in the public schools. Designed to serve over 1,000 low-income children. The program sought to instill in young listeners a genuine and lasting excitement for fine music. Developing and maintaining educational outreach programs remains an important priority for the Festival. Public Television audiences nationwide were able to enjoy the Each Festival in 1985 with the one-hour special ‚ÄúHandel and Bach: The Timeliness Of Genius.‚Äù Produced in partnership with WHYY television in Philadelphia, the program celebrated the tercentenary of the births of Bach and Handel, Tony Randall narrated the presentation and Michael Korn directed the Philadelphia Singers and Concerto Soloists. In conjunction with the tercentenary celebration, the Bach Festival sponsored a series of lectures on Bach‚Äôs life and work. The collected lectures were published as ‚ÄúThe Universal Bach‚Äù by the American Philosophical Society. Lawrence Dreyfus, Christoph Wolff, Robert Marshall and Richard L. Jeske participated. In 1987, the Bach Festival held a Young Artists Competition for children up to the age of 14. Because few competitions exist for this age group, the Festival Board felt that young musicians should be encouraged. Eminent Philadelphia musicians judged the competition. The winners received cash prizes. The first prize winner was the featured soloist in the Festival‚Äôs Young People‚Äôs Concert. By 1987, the Bach Festival expanded its season to six weeks. To open the season the Festival orchestrated a major event called ‚ÄúBach Around the Clock‚Äù in cooperation with WFLN-FM and Mellon Bank. The day-long schedule of performances by area music groups was broadcast live by WFLN and reached an audience of over 30,000 listeners. The performances and interviews with the musicians offered a taste of the Festival‚Äôs upcoming season. This annual event continued through 1992. The following lists outstanding events of recent seasons: Men‚Äôs choir from St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge, England The complete Bach Brandenburg Concertos played by the New York Chamber Soloists The complete Bach Goldberg Variations played by pianist Clive Swansbourne The complete Bach cello suites played by Pieter Wispelwey and Scott Kluksdahl Several performances by The Tallis Scholars, the ‚Äúsuperstars of Renaissance choral music‚Äù Collaboration with The Philadelphia Singers and Concerto Soloists to produce Bach‚Äôs St. Matthew Passion, St. John Passion, and Mass in B Minor Concerts by organists from churches in Arnstadt and Leipzig, Germany where Bach himself played Concert by Chanticleer. the world‚Äôs only fully professional chorus Paul Galbraith, guitarist from Scotland, played the world premier of a transcription of Bach‚Äôs complete sonatas and partitas originally written for violin Concert by Musica Antiqua K√∂ln, the world‚Äôs foremost chamber ensemble Paul Jordan played Bach‚Äôs Art of the Fugue on the organ Concert by the St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig, Germany (Bach‚Äôs own church) in their first American tour, for an audience of over 1100 (the largest in our history) The current season continues our strong emphasis on excellent programming. 1997 was the beginning of a project entitled JS BACH - the Partnership. Joining Shipley, Bach and Central High, the Bach Festival acted as the umbrella organization for this partnership which produced four full days of courses about Bach as well as preparations for a joint concert with the chorus from the Shipley School and the Central High orchestra. 100 free tickets to the Bach Festival concert at the conclusion of one of these days were provided to students. The Festival‚Äôs support allowed these local students to sing with the choir from St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, Germany. Additionally, the 80 boys of the choir stayed in the homes of Shipley and Central High students. Philadelphia was the only American city in which home stays were offered to the choir. We hope that the interaction of German and American young people will promote a model of the season‚Äôs motto of the Bach Festival: ‚ÄúWhen he was asked, ‚ÄòWhat can we do for world peace?‚Äô, renowned cellist Pablo Casals said, ‚ÄòPLAY BACH!‚Äô‚Äù The Bach Festival of Philadelphia feels it is part of our mission to take the music of Bach into neighborhoods where it is unknown. In 1988 the Board of Directors decided to broaden the scope of The Festival by becoming a presenting organization rather than a producing one. This enabled the Bach Festival to present concerts by eminent artists such as Joshua Rifkin and his Bach Chamber Ensemble, soprano Julianne Baird, harpsichordist John Gibbons and the Italian chamber orchestral Soloist Veneti. These Concerts offered many Delaware Valley audiences their first opportunity hear world-class artists. In subsequent seasons, the Festival continued a commitment to present the extraordinary treasures of the Baroque era performed by professional specialists. For its 1990 season, the Festival expanded its offerings to include numerous educational events which included lecture/recitals, master classes and ‚ÄúLiving Program Notes‚Äù - short pre-concert talks by experts on the music to be performed or by the performers themselves. We offered these events because we believe better-informed audiences receive far more enjoyment and enrichment from the music. Also they are more likely to remain involved with the Festival in future years. During the 1991 season the Bach Festival Chamber Orchestra under the direction of internationally renowned Baroque violinist Stanley Ritchie was formed. The ensemble consisted of Baroque instrumental specialists largely from the Delaware Va1ley. The debut was a great success, achieving a standard of excellence found in only a handful of Baroque Orchestras world \\vide The caliber of its performance was such that an immediate recording offer was received from Dorian Records. In 1992 the season expanded from six weeks to seven months. This new schedule proved to be more convenient to audiences. It also gave the Festival access to a greater selection of touring artists. In addition, the change allowed for more effective promotion of each event and kept the Festival in the public eye throughout the year. In 1997, The Bach Festival began a unique educational program in conjunction with Temple University. Whereas the educational outreach of most arts organizations consists of one 45-minute presentation to a school group, The Bach Festival actually became a partner with the Temple curriculum The music faculty at Temple selected its best instrumental and choral students to par1icipate in a term-long project that featured two cantatas and an orchestral suite of Bach The Bach Festival then brought in noted German Bach scholar and conductor Helmuth Rilling from Germany, who rehearsed the students for three days and subsequently present these works at a Center City church. This important project provided the students with an opportunity to learn and perform the music of Bach. Furthermore, the Temple music faculty expressed an interest in continuing our collaboration. ¬© The Bach Festival of Philadelphia, Inc. 8806 Germantown Ave Philadelphia, PA 19118 phone 215.247.BACH Home Calendar Tickets Support Podcast Shop Team Info Orgs Contact Home Page Welcome from Maestro Sternberg 2007 Bach Festival Week Festival Celebrates Successful 2006 Season Complete Organ Works on Podcast Michael Korn‚Äôs Induction on Philadelphia‚Äôs Walk of Fame Musical and Numerical Symbolism Discovery of Unknown Manuscripts Find a Room in Philadelphia Season Calendar Find a Bach Event in Philadelphia Tickets for All Events Support the Festival Donations Donor List Bequests Underwriting Volunteering In-Kind Gifts Advertise Advertiser List Annual Report Business Analysis Guidestar Listing Podcast Setup Violin Concerto Live Complete Bach Organ Works Bach Cantatas Selected Organ Works Posters Bach Coloring Book Board of Directors Advisory Board Staff History Mission Educational Outreach Public Relations Annual Reports Flyers Press Clippings Come Bach Newsletters Previous Seasons Program Books Global Bach Community United States World Contact the Office Contact the Webmaster",19);arrFiles[153]=new Array(154,"docs/annualreport2004-05.pdf","2006-09-07","annualreport2004-05","","","  The Bach Festival of Philadelphia, Inc. 219 E Willow Grove Ave J2 Philadelphia, PA 19118, USA Phone/fax: +1-(215) 247-BACH www.Bach-Fest.org/ Office@Bach-Fest.org Content Letter from the President Introduction 1.

Its motto  Bach to the Future  has proven to be most characteristic of the season achievements in every aspect - artistically, financially, and organizationally. After some difficult years, the stakeholder value of the Bach Festival has skyrocketed. Artistically, our customers have been used to high quality since the Bach Festival \'s inception in 1976 by Michael Korn (you see his photo in the background throughout this report) with dedicated members of the Chestnut Hill community. This season has surpassed expectations with a number of innovative products. First and foremost was the premiere of Johann Sebastian Bach \'s five masses integrated in liturgical settings including the mighty B Minor Mass in an Anglo-Catholic service at the Philadelphia Cathedral. Another focus was on educational outreach for schools and parents and on providing opportunities for young artists and ensembles to perform with us. Financially, the year has also been very successful. The financial highlights are tripled revenues and a major reduction of old debt and liabilities. The donor base has been significantly broadened, demonstrating support for our mission from private individuals, foundations as well as corporate sponsors. Organizationally, we built up our personnel resources and started a strategic assessment of the organization and its diverse markets. To ensure the financial viability and artistic quality of the Festival, we hired an experienced management team and increased the size of our board of directors. The format expanded into a 10-day festival week in the spring and a series of monthly concerts from September through June in venues all over Philadelphia. We were able to explore this path thanks to Chara & John C. Haas and Allen Model. Without their vision and early engagement, the Bach Festival would probably not exist anymore. Their seed money has brought us  Bach on track  and triggered a wave of support. Philadelphia can be proud of these impresarios for having saved one of the city \'s important cultural institutions. Hence, while you enjoy reviewing a colorful and innovative season, we can put the final touch on the preparations of the 30th anniversary season 2005/06. We look forward to presenting you a very special program building on the hard work and success of this past season. We can do it, if you join the passion! Yours truly,  Samuel T. Swansen, Esq. -3-    Introduction The 29th season has been both a crucial and very successful one in the history of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia ≠ artistically, organizationally, and financially. Over the past few years, the high artistic reputation of the Bach Festival has been compromised by unfortunate financial management as well as inadequate marketing and development. With the 29th season we got  Bach to the Future  and built up new trust within the community. This resulted in contributions from many previous supporters and also new sources. In addition, we improved our cost structure, strengthened profitability, and improved marketing and development. All these efforts combined enabled the Bach Festival to make a good showing in 2004/05 both in terms of earnings and revenues. As a consequence, the artistic quality of our products - musical performances, lectures and educational programs ≠ was again of the highest standards, enhancing the cultural life of the entire Philadelphia region. Focusing on the rich heritage of music created by Johann Sebastian Bach and his Baroque contemporaries, the Bach Festival seeks to provide a unique forum for local, national and international artists who perform programs that enlighten and enrich the lives of Delaware Valley audiences. We strive to engage the local communities of Philadelphia in music- and art-related activities and to increase business opportunities and tourism for the area. The 29th season program continued this mission, bringing the finest international musicians to a fair number of venues in the city. We believe that it is important for a vital community that world-class concerts take place also in local neighborhoods and not only in the big venues downtown. This particularly benefits retired and impaired people to participate in local activities. The stream of outside visitors our concerts bring to communities has also been beneficial for local shops and restaurants. The Bach Festival offered a broad portfolio of Baroque music unrivaled in terms of quantity and quality by any other organization in town. The 29th season prepared the ground to establish the Bach Festival of Philadelphia as an important event in the international Baroque music scene on the East coast. Nevertheless we have still a long way to go to get  Bach to the Future .  -4-    1. Artistic Excellence Our concept for the  Bach to the Future  season focused on innovative opportunities to experience music with all senses and socialize with fellow music connoisseurs of the local community. This manifested itself in the Opening Night, a candlelight concert with dinner in historic style; Bach \'s five masses in liturgical setting; in the Art of Fugue, Literature, Architecture, and of Fine Arts concert, and plans for a concert cruise. The format was expanded to a ten-day festival week as in Leipzig and monthly ancillary concerts. At these events, which took place in venues all over the city, we once again introduced the finest artists and leading scholars to the Philadelphia community. The monthly ancillary concerts combined cutting edge programs with high artistic quality. The Opening Night presented four major organ works of JS Bach at Old Christ Church in the Historic district performed by Ann Elise Smoot. A native Philadelphian now residing in London, she delighted the audience at the concert as well as with her presence in the following colonial style dinner at the nearby City Tavern. Martin Haselbˆck, the Scholars of London, the DalÌ Quartet, Solomiya Ivakhiv, and the Jean-FranÁois Proulx piano trio were presented in the following months. In April 2005, the Bach Festival Week 2005 presented the complete cycle of JS Bach \'s five masses the landmark B Minor Mass as well as the little known  Lutheran masses , which Bach assembled from his favorite cantatas. As a unique spiritual and musical event each was integrated into a church service. Thereby we reached out to the major Philadelphia congregations including diverse and underserved populations (Philadelphia Cathedral in the West, Bright Hope Baptist in the North, Church of the Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square, Old Christ Church in the Historic district, and St. Mark \'s in center city). The world \'s leading Bach scholar, Prof. Christoph Wolff from Harvard University and the Bach Festival Leipzig held the introductory lecture and gave the week a uniting blessing. Peter Burwasser \'s following article  Welcome Bach  in the Citypaper of March 31 testifies to the high quality and citywide attention of the Bach Festival Week 2005.  -5-    Citypaper  March 31-April 6, 2005  Welcome Bach  A rejuvenated Bach Festival recaptures its original glory.  by Peter Burwasser The Bach Festival of Philadelphia turns 29 this season. It is a cause for celebration, to be sure, but in a very real sense, the festival has been reborn. It began life as a labor of love for the founder and then director of the Philadelphia Singers, Michael Korn. Korn was a masterful director of the great choral works of Bach and used his reputation to attract many superb musicians. Korn \'s tragic death in 1991 was a major loss to the Philadelphia music community and signaled a somnolent period for the Bach Festival, which contracted into a series of small, poorly marketed concerts and recitals in Chestnut Hill. Perhaps sensing an imminent demise, the festival \'s board of directors called upon the venerable conductor (and Philadelphia resident) Jonathan Sternberg to assume the post of artistic director in March last year. Guido Houben was also brought in as executive director. This turns out to be a fascinating and dynamic pairing. Houben, a German born and trained composer, has done post graduate work in nonprofit management, combining musical and marketing acumen in a way that has introduced notable vitality and imagination into the enterprise. Sternberg, an extremely well-connected eminence grise, is reinvigorating the Festival with diverse talent, including soprano Julianne Baird and pianist Charles Abramovic. He is himself a true pioneer in the field of contemporary baroque performance, as the conductor of some of the first recorded performances of Bach \'s cantatas in 1951. Sternberg might just as well be speaking about his new job when he declares that  baroque music has a new lease on life.  As an artist who has seen Bach performance undergo a sea-change in scholarship and audience appreciation in a generation, he is quick to cut through the debates over how to play the music.  What bothers me is that we are living in a celebrity culture, and Bach is no longer the celebrity but the performers are.  He is sanguine on the subject of the authenticity of the instruments, a matter of tremendous interest among many younger performers.  We can play Bach perfectly fine on our new contraptions.  The festival has concerts planned for the whole season, which continues through June, but the coming days are a climax of activity with seven Bach programs in the offing. Four relatively unknown Lutheran masses will be performed as integral religious ceremonies at four Philadelphia churches, utilizing the exceptional musical faculties at the specific institutions. The culmination of that series will be two performances of a fifth mass, the mighty Mass    in B Minor, one as a religious ceremony and one as a concert performance, both under the baton of Maestro Sternberg with the Bach Festival Orchestra and a trim vocal company supplied by the fine locally based Voces Novae et Antiquae. This magnificent work is a cornerstone of Western music, and Sternberg is far from alone when he sings its praises.  I discover new things in it every time I encounter it. It is one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written.  The Mass in B Minor, like all of Bach, gives the musicians very little concrete direction about performance practice.  There is absolutely no indication whatsoever about tempi and dynamics,  declares Sternberg. His inclination, hewing back to an earlier style of Bach playing, is to slower tempi than are currently fashionable.  I have a private recording of the music conducted by Georges Enescu [the great Romanian composer and musician] that is remarkable. It is slower than anything you hear today, and it makes the music sound much more religious.  Bach spent part of his career as a religious composer, but he also had a considerable stint as a court composer writing exclusively secular music. Two other concerts feature music from that second world, including a a recital by the extraordinary pianist Jeremy Denk that is a co-venture with the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society. There will also be a special concert centering around a single piece of music, the great  Chaconne  from the Partita for Solo Violin in D minor. This magical work has fascinated many composers through the ages, and it has received many interesting treatments, including piano versions by Brahms (for left hand alone) and Busoni, a piano and violin arrangement by Schumann, and a solo guitar edition by Segovia. All of those manifestations will appear on a recital Tuesday evening, beginning with the original as played by Philadelphia Orchestra violinist Jason DePue. Later in the season, two other instrumental masterpieces are scheduled, The Art of the Fugue and Musical Offering. Sternberg vividly recalls the excitement that his early recordings of Bach generated among the music-loving public. Those efforts ignited a fire that still burns today.  The music is loved even more now.

We are proud that the program succeeded in attracting a number of excellent artists and young audiences, and that it found support from new donors such as The Tabitha Foundation for the improvement of children \'s lives. To counterbalance rising musical illiteracy levels in the worsened public school system, where children often enough have no exposure at all to classical music, we  offered ten percent of all our regular concert tickets for free to pre-collegiate school classes. We have partnered for their distribution with an organization that works continuously with most schools of Greater Philadelphia. In addition, several concerts were offered at  1 admission for college students and children under the motto  Bach for a buck . On a more playful note, Mr. Bach \'s Birthday Party, around March 21, is an annual event to introduce children (and their parents!) to the music of J.S. Bach through music presentations and  -8-    activities, dances, costumes, and discussions. In our Future Generation Series with four concerts we featured young talents of the Delaware Valley area. By giving young and deserving soloists and chamber ensembles the opportunity to present the major works of Johann Sebastian Bach in a new setting, we enable them to enhance their professional development and to explore future ways of interpreting Bach \'s music. Chapeau for the Chaconne! Jason DePue of the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yuja Wang who had just given her Kimmel Center debut with the China Philharmonic Orchestra excelled given the opportunity to perform Bach \'s Chaconne and transcriptions. Prof. Charles Abramovic and Prof. Michael Marissen from Swarthmore College joined them for the concert and an introductory lecture during the Festival Week 2005. After the Chaconne concert, selected entries to the  Bach to the Future  competition for creative interpretation of Bach \'s music were presented, continuing the Philadelphia tradition of Leopold Stokowski and Peter Schickele. Artists from New York, London, and Philadelphia were featured with performances including multimedia and elements of rap, jazz, and pop.  The Art of Fugue, Literature, Architecture, and of Fine Arts: Imagine the large and daedal nave of the Church of the Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square with its colorful stained glass windows by Tiffany and Merson. Then the theme of the Art of Fugue \'s first contrapunctus rises from one corner of the room. One after another, from different points of the room, the other members of the Dali String Quartet join in and the architecture of Bach \'s last masterpiece evolves in its magnificent beauty. Interwoven with the music, excerpts from Vikram Seth \'s best-selling romantic novel  An Equal Music  on the Art of Fugue will be read by James Pope. Thus, you \'ll get to experience music, literature, fine arts, and architecture in combined beauty. And here \'s the wake-up call for this event on Saturday, May 14, 7.30pm: If you \'re a college kid or younger, you will get the whole bang for a buck only: Admission  1.  This announcement from the March issue of the Bach Festival \'s eNewsletter  Come Bach  describes best the penultimate Future Generation Series concert of the season.  -9-    2. Organizational Build-up During the past years, it had become obvious that an organizational overhaul was needed to ensure the Bach Festival \'s well-known and continued artistic excellence and to reach larger audiences. Therefore, an assessment and strategic review was begun in extra board sessions and during a retreat together with our consultant Thaddeus Squire (Peregrine Arts). In meetings with professional development organizations such as Leadership, Inc., La Salle University Nonprofit Center, and the Arts & Business Council additional resources were explored to make the Bach Festival robust again. As a consequence, the board of directors has been considerably expanded in various directions to broaden its expertise and resources: Kathlyn Taylor, special projects director at the office for alumni affairs of Princeton University; Ellen Bildersee, music teacher and concert organizer at the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel Synagogue in Elkins Park; Dr. Peter Hopkins, music director at St. Peter \'s Church of Philadelphia in the Historic district; Dr. Terry Bergman, head of the Horsham Quaker School. To ensure the financial viability and artistic quality of the Festival, an experienced management team has been hired. The new artistic director, Maestro Jonathan Sternberg, is a longtime Chestnut Hill resident and a highly regarded international conductor who was the first to record Bach Cantatas on LP ever in 1951. He also premiered Leopold Stokowski \'s transcriptions of Bach masterpieces in Vienna shortly after WW II as well as a number of contemporary music works all over the world throughout his career. Dr. Guido Houben was born and raised in JS Bach \'s own country and came to the US with considerable experience in arts management and politics. He graduated from Harvard University with a Master in Public Administration focusing on financial management for nonprofit organizations. Dr. Theodor Nason and Nathan Chamberlain complete the staff as webmaster and project assistant respectively. Together with the board they revamped the business emphasizing more efficiency in internal operations and more effectiveness for the customers. Most visible effort to optimize costs and processes was the relaunch of the new website www.BachFest.org offering major improvements in regard to transparency, information, tie-in merchandise, and services such as a professional ticket service (www.Bach-Fest. tix.com). In terms of marketing, the management built up an email list of 1500 subscribers who receive the Festival \'s monthly newsletter  Come Bach  and a database of over 10,000 households who re- 10 -    ceive the annual program brochure. Articles and human interest stories in the Philadelphia print media testify of the improved public relations (see the archives at www.Bach-Fest.org). Finally, the Bach Festival sought strategic alliances and cooperation partners. In April 2004, Jonathan Sternberg and Dr. Guido Houben had already met with the directors of the  mother of all  Bach Festivals in Leipzig to prepare an international collaboration. As a consequence, we adapted Leipzig \'s  theme  Bach and the Future  to our own 29th season and invited artists who had been presented there such as Martin Haselbˆck and the artistic director himself, Prof. Christoph Wolff. The collaboration with four major Philadelphia congregations for Bach \'s masses during the Festival Week 2005 can be seen by the same token and as groundwork for future cooperation (see the following article  Bach forces unite! from the Philadelphia Music Makers).

Financial Consolidation The 2004/05 season has been a very successful one in financial terms, too. The major goals have been fulfilled: broadening the donor base and increasing revenues, cutting overhead costs, and reducing liabilities. An initial meeting with the William Penn Foundation at the beginning of the season led to a business analysis by the Nonprofit Finance Fund (see www. Bach-Fest.org/support.htm). This helped to better understand and communicate the financial situation of the Bach Festival.  Profit & Loss  1 4 0 ,0 0 0 1 2 0 ,0 0 0 1 0 0 ,0 0 0   8 0 ,0 0 0 6 0 ,0 0 0 4 0 ,0 0 0  business plan; both significantly increased their previous level of engagement and supported us with two times  5,000 each. This enabled the Bach Festival to continue operations and to expand its format. As a result, many previous supporters were once more engaged such as former presidents Martin Heckscher, Karl Spaeth, and Tony Carey as well as the Chestnut Hill Community Association. Furthermore, a fair number of new supporters from individual donors like Gerry Lenfest and Raymond Perelman to foundations and corporate sponsors like the Wachovia Foundation were attracted by Maestro Sternberg \'s vision (see table on the back cover for a complete donor list). Revenue  Expenses  Overall, the Bach Festival 2 0 ,0 0 0 maintained a diverse reve0 nue structure 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 from grants, Y e ar donations, program book ads, and ticket revenues, and strengthened additional From the beginning of the fiscal income streams such as merchanyear, John C. Haas and the Leo dising (see the Financial Highlights Model Foundation placed trust in table for details). The Franklin the new management and its Foundation \'s release of restrictions - 15 -    on a grant of  7,000 from the year 2000 constituted another positive influence on the cash flow. Initially, only the income of the endowment could be used for educational programs. After the release, the capital stock is free of restrictions, too. In addition to increasing revenues by factor three, we were able to cut administrative costs and introduce scale measures such as a professional online donation and ticket service. The engagements of a new Certified Public Accountant to take care of the financial reviews and of a professional payroll service for bookkeeping were ex0 tremely valuable in this regard. So was -10,000 the relationship with -20,000 the Community Accountants   -30,000 In 2004/05, the Bach Festival was therefore able to renegotiate most of its  -40,000 -50,000 -60,000  decade old financial obligations and reduce its liabilities by almost  30,000. Over the course of the last 12 months, all loans from board members, an old commercial credit line, obligations towards a previous executive director, and a ten year old liability for a concert performance with the Philadelphia Singers have been taken care of. Now, the only outstanding current liabilities of  15,000 are a revolving credit line with a commercial bank and a liability for a concert in 1995 with the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia.  Reduction in Liabilities  The Bach Festival of Philadelphia has laid the ground with its 29th season: We are on the way to command an excellent competitive position to better serve our communities. Join the Passion and we will get Bach to the Future!  - 16 -    Financial Highlights  Income  Jul  \'04 Jun  \'05 Ordinary Income/Expense Income Ticket Income Grants Government Corporations Foundations Total Grants Donations Board Individuals Total Donations Program Book Advertisements Other Total Income Expense Program Expenses Production Expense Promotions Expenses Total Program Expenses Administrative Expenses Administrative Expenses Payroll Expenses Salaries and Wages Contractual Services Total Administrative Expenses Total Expense Net Ordinary Income Net Income 11,772.59 9,850.38 32,056.46 900.00 54,579.43 95,793.81 24,859.76 24,859.76 INVESTING ACTIVITIES Equipment - Cost Net cash provided by Investing Activities FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net Assets perm. restricted Net Assets unrestricted Net cash provided by Financing Activities Net cash increase for period Cash at beginning of period Cash at end of period -6,799.00 6,799.00 0.00 -3,873.31 4,815.08 941.77 -199.97 -199.97 29,017.95 12,196.43 41,214.38 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net Income Adjustments to reconcile Net Income to net cash provided by operations: Accrued Interest Accrued liabilities Deferred Income - Ticket Sales Notes Payable ≠ Credit Line 1 Notes Payable ≠ Credit Line 2 Loans Payable - Board loans Net cash provided by Operating Activities -89.00 -19,652.95 900.00 -4,100.40 -2,690.75 -2,900.00 -3,673.34 24,859.76 14,997.00 38,178.70 53,175.70 12,923.00 6,069.88 120,653.57 TOTAL LIABILITIES & EQUITY 1,141.74 Equity Net Assets unrestricted Net Income Total Equity -39,098.05 24,859.76 -14,238.29 10,242.00 500.00 20,560.00 31,302.00 LIABILITIES & EQUITY Liabilities Chamber Orchestra 1995 Concert Deferred Income - Ticket Sales Notes Payable ≠ Credit Line Total Liabilities 6,163.00 900.00 8,317.03 15,380.03 17,182.99  Balance  Jun 30,  \'05 ASSETS Current Assets Fixed Assets TOTAL ASSETS 941.77 199.97 1,141.74  Cash Flow  Jul  \'04 Jun  \'05    A World of Thanks  (reflects contributions from July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005)  Goldberg Circle ( 100+) Barry Burd David Burns Tony Vogel Carey Frederic Cohen Mr. & Mrs. Paul W.

Abramovic: How do you capture the harpsichord sound? Bach Works for Flute. Mimi Stillman, flute; Charles Abramovic, piano. March 17, 2007 at First Unitarian Church, 2125 Chestnut Street. Bach Festival of Philadelphia 215-247-Bach or www.bach-fest.org.  Baroque music on modern instruments: It takes a special talent  TOM PURDOM The period instrument movement is based on the idea that (1) Baroque and Renaissance composers wrote for the instruments actually used in their day and (2) their music sounds best when it \'s played on instruments that have the strengths and weaknesses they had in mind when they composed it. Generally speaking, that reasoning makes sense. But musicians can play some Baroque works on modern instruments if they understand the need to make adjustments. Charles Abramovic quieted most of my biases in favor of historical instruments when he accompanied Mimi Stillman \'s performance of Bach \'s works for solo flute during the Bach Festival. Abramovic accompanied Stillman on the piano, rather than the historically correct harpsichord-- an instrument that creates a critically different type of sound, in spite of its superficial resemblance to its successor. The modern grand piano is a percussion instrument that hammers heavy, high-tension strings. The harpsichord is a plucking instrument rigged with light, lowtension strings. Let the fingers provide the musclepower Abramovic discussed some of the issues involved in the switch to modern instruments during the concert. When he played, he made several adjustments that helped him compensate for the difference: The piano lid, for example, was set at its lowest level, in recognition of the enormous volume the modern piano commands, compared to the harpsichord. Abramovic \'s hands traveled across the keys with a light-fingered, high-speed touch that captured most of the rippling rush of the harpsichord, even if it couldn \'t reproduce the twang of a plucked instrument. That kind of speed comes naturally on the harpsichord, with its lighter action, but I would assume it takes extra effort on the piano. It looked to me as if Abramovic was even reproducing the harpsichordist \'s stance. Pianists can exercise their arms and shoulders-- the harder you bang, the louder the sound-- but on a harpsichord, the extra pressure usually produces broken strings, with no increase in volume. Abramovic sat at the piano with his elbows, wrists and hands level and let his fingers provide all the muscle power, just as Couperin advised in his text on the harpsichord. Not coasting on her youth Mimi Stillman was the youngest wind student ever accepted at Curtis when she entered the school at age 12 in 1994. She could have glided along on that line in her resumÈ for some time, but fortunately she hasn \'t. Stillman keeps developing technically and artistically. Other flutists may play these pieces as well, but I doubt that anyone could have played them better.  http://www.broadstreetreview.com/print_version.php?idc=1&ida=394&print=1  5/3/2007    Broad Street Review  Page 2 of 2  The recital was something of a tour de force. Stillman elected to play all of Bach \'s works for solo flute, accompanied and unaccompanied. She played nine pieces altogether, which meant she was blowing and fingering for more than two hours, including short breaks that she and Abramovic frequently filled with comments. Competition from a disco In addition to functioning as Mimi Stillman \'s regular partner, Abramovic is one of Philadelphia \'s major talents: a pianist with an international career as soloist and accompanist. I won \'t make a fuss about the instrumentation when music of this quality is played by musicians of this caliber, with a full understanding of the issues raised by modern instruments. The concert ended with a display of good old-fashioned fortitude. Due to a scheduling fumble, a disco in the church basement erupted about two minutes before the end. I \'m not exaggerating when I say the outburst shook the building. Stillman and Abramovic played on through the artillery fire and managed to keep Bach alive despite the assault from the lower depths. I may waver now and then in my support of the harpsichord over the piano, but I \'ll never alter my belief that amplified music proves conclusively that change and progress are not necessarily synonymous.

SAVE THIS | EMAIL THIS | Close  Simone Dinnerstein vivifies two new works inspired by Bach chorales  By David Patrick Stearns  Inquirer Music Critic  LISA-MARIE MAZZUCCO Pianist Simone Dinnerstein J.S. Bach seems as suited to our time as he was to his own - maybe more so, considering that some 18th-century minds thought him a bit old-fashioned. So after the Bach Festival of Philadelphia commissioned a pair of composers to write new pieces based on Bach chorales, the field of possibilities was as wide open as can be at Thursday \'s recital by pianist Simone Dinnerstein at Trinity Center for Urban Life. You couldn \'t have planned the opposing viewpoints of composers David Post and Philip Lasser. Post chose a particularly searching, linear musical basis for his Variations and Fugue on Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ and found much engaging, earnest fodder in the bass-register depths of the modern piano; Lasser chose stately, chordal source material for Twelve Variations on Nimm von uns, Herr du treuer Gott, and took off like a shot, with a Prokofiev-inspired toccata and gentle ostinatos resembling New Age music (though used with unsoothing intensity). Lasser was particularly applauded. Naturally, the two pieces were positioned in counterpoint to Bach - selected preludes and fugues from Bach \'s Well-Tempered Clavier Book II - which Dinnerstein played with well-balanced elegance and modern coloristic awareness. The 18th-century harpsichord seemed not even to be a point of  1 of 2  3/24/2007 9:13 AM    Simone Dinnerstein vivifies two new works inspired by Bach chorales | ...  http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Simone+...  reference, particularly in the sound world of the splendid Fazioli piano at hand. Only early-instrument champions would have minded. Dinnerstein also avoided the fussy motivic spotlighting and intellectualism of Glenn Gould, which is particularly appreciated when Bach develops tiny cells of music in a minute progression so organic that even minimal performer intrusion feels inappropriate. And what was Beethoven \'s Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111 doing at the end of her Bach Festival recital? Like a Rorschach inkblot, this sonata has a way of embodying whatever else you \'ve heard lately. The final movement is based on a theme similar to what Bach would have used in a fugue. Lasser \'s wide-ranging variations couldn \'t have existed without the precedent of Beethoven - whose expression is so wide-ranging in Op. 111 that it stumbles onto an eccentric precursor of American jazz. Emotionally, intellectually and technically, this music couldn \'t be more demanding, and Dinnerstein \'s performance was in a league with any of the great Beethoven pianists of our time. Unlike Emanuel Ax \'s Beethoven on Monday, Dinnerstein avoided existential horror; the music \'s mercurial qualities weren \'t outbursts so much as a musical landscape with endless possibilities and no boundaries. I \'ve heard Dinnerstein play fine performances, but none with the thunderbolt-hurling confidence of this one.  Contact music critic David Patrick Stearns at dstearns@phillynews.com.

Then there \'s that nasty old expression about best-laid plans: Friday \'s festival opening at the Church of the Holy Trinity had, under logistically trying conditions, an artistic triumph that few heard. The New York Collegium \'s program of three cantatas from Bach \'s first year in Leipzig (Nos. 22, 23, and the expansive 75) was as fine as one could hope for, even in the great early music festivals of Europe. Some 100 listeners showed up - in travel conditions that forced some players to drive six hours - in what turned out to be Collegium \'s last concert before a money-dictated hiatus. Nobody knows when it will play again. Painfully amateurish groups such as Vox Ama Deus go on forever here, but New York doesn \'t maintain its Collegium, which had a sober 1998 start under Gustav Leonhardt but now, under Parrott, understands its repertoire so thoroughly that even out-of-sorts moments (however few) were transcended by knowledge of the music \'s message and manner of expression. That \'s the greatest barrier between Bach \'s great but neglected cantatas and a 21st-century public. Composed for Sunday church, the cantatas can be intimidating with severe texts laden with condemning judgments, set to music with a kind of reckless spontaneity not often found elsewhere in Bach. Melodies spun out at tour-de-force lengths    and hymns superimposed, with breathtaking logic, over orchestral writing as animated as the Brandenburg Concertos. Such things can only be truly externalized by those who have spent their lives immersed in the idiom - like Parrott. Collegium \'s chorus had just four singers who revealed the rigorous counterpoint with gratifying clarity, avoiding the potentially suffocating weight of a larger group. Soloists include an ideal Bach alto in the focused, full-bodied voice of Kirsten Sollek. But even less-distinguished tenor Marc Molomot and bass Curtis Streetman never detracted from the performance \'s overall refinement. Musical intent was clear when the notes weren \'t. Parrott unsuccessfully avoided clumsiness in the tricky opening of Cantata 75; better that than steamrolling the meaning out of such passages - as others do. Smaller luxuries included recitatives supported by vibrato-less strings creating a distinctive blanket of sound thanks to being perfectly in tune. The world needs this group. Let us pray.

Opening night of the Bach Festival Week highlights Bach \'s vocal works in the year 1723. The cantatas, presented by The New York Collegium, represent the pieces associated with what Bach scholars consider Bach \'s  most important post,  in the city of Leipzig, Germany. Cantatas BWV 22 & 23 were composed as audition pieces in Bach \'s campaign to attain the dual position of Cantor of St. Thomas \' Church and Civic Music Director at Liepzig. Bach scholars believe Cantata 23, an intense, complex piece, was composed in hopes of awing the adjudicators for the position, and is considered one of Bach \'s greatest compositional achievements, while Cantata 22 has a light, less pretentious feel - intended to appeal to a less sophisticated musical ear. The third piece to be performed by The New York Collegium, Cantata BWV 75, was first performed at Bach \'s inauguration at Leipzig. A 14-movement cantata based on the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Cantata BWV 75 includes the text  The Meek Shall Not Go Empty  and features the use of the oboe d \'amore (an alto version of the oboe invented a few years earlier in the region around Leipzig.) Both pieces were composed as liturgical reflections on the season of Lent. The New York Collegium, a collection of musicians internationally renowned for their interpretation and presentation of 17th and 18th century classical music, is composed primarily of New Yorkbased performers, and feature authentic instruments in thir concerts.  Instrumentation can vary significantly from concert to concert, depending on the musical works being performed,  said Michael Scagnoli, executive director of The Collegium.  This season alone our three major concerts have all showcased very distinctive instruments. Back in October for a French program, we featured musette, hurdy-gurdy, and trumpet; our Viennese program in January featured trombone; in tonight \'s concert, the oboe d \'amore is a key instrument.  The size of the ensemble also varies according to content and style being performed, according to Scagnoli.  We \'ve presented large scale concerts that have 40-50 players and singers on stage, and very intimate concerts with no more than eight musicians,  said Scagnoli.  We \'re lucky to have a strong core group of New York musicians who play with us in every program.  The New York Collegium was created as an alternative to continually performing in Europe, and since its inception in 1998, Parrott \'s musicians have been continually lauded for their presentation of many adventurous programs, spanning international boundaries and time periods. Parrott \'s credentials are strengthened by a long history of propagating the early music period, and his experience on the podium is reinforced by his scholarly ambitions, which include co-editing the New Oxford Book of Carols, and writing The Essential Bach Choir. Perhaps best known as music director and conductor of the Taverner Choir, Consort and Players, a group specializing in music from the Baroque and Renaissance eras, Parrott has also worked with more contemporary ensembles, and maintains an international conducting schedule both in opera houses and for symphonies. Although its primary focus is performance, an important part of The New York Collegium \'s    mission is education. Preceding each performance, a musicologist, historian or theologian speaks to the audience as an informative introduction to the concert. Each speaker is pertainent to that evening \'s performance. Tonight, Bach scholar Michael Marissen, Professor of Music at Swarthmore College, will present a free pre-concert talk at 7:15 p.m.. The Collegium also participates in a weekly teaching program in public school classrooms, started five years ago.  The initiative to teach was launched because we saw an opportunity to provide deserving children who weren \'t receiving music classes with a different kind of music education experience,  said Scagnoli.  The goal when we began was to deeply engage students at a single school over several years of consistent study, rather than paying brief visits to many schools. In doing so we have been able to actively involve every student in skilled musical activities and have created a dynamic musical culture within the school community.  Led by Education Program Director Nina Stern, The New York Collegium members are currently in residence at Manhattan \'s Ella Baker School and The AmPark Neighborhood School. Stern, a leading recorder and classical clarinet players, also serves as the principal recorder player for The Collegium.  Leipzig 1723: Mr. Bach Comes to Town.

The Bach Festival of Philadelphia  Inside Arts in Motion \'s studio, it sounds like water \'s being heated for tea--a constant, escalating coo, which is actually half a ton of technology at whirring work. There are computers, speakers, a projector, a keyboard and, somewhat anachronistically, a piano. Founder Eric Haeker and DJ Ben Camp are getting ready for their set at this year \'s Bach Festival. The weeklong event, March 16-25, will have few silent moments. There will be soloists, cantatas, flutes and choirs, Philadelphia talent--such as celebrated pianist Simone Dinnerstein--and musicians from abroad, the echo appeal of church locales, and orchestral performances within the well-planned walls of the Kimmel Center. Arts in Motion \'s performance will last just 25 minutes on the 25th, but it may very well be the loudest, with the help of microphones, amps and a crowd that could decide, after a minute or two, to get up and dance.  Basically what we \'re doing is re-orchestrating it,  explains Camp.  Just how Bach re-orchestrated Vivaldi [for the harpsichord], I \'m re-orchestrating Bach. I \'m not changing any of the notes in some cases, but I \'m adding new textures. You wouldn \'t normally hear a solo violin line with swirling synths and a pulsing beat driving underneath it.  Add projected visuals that colorfully throb, which explain--and are in fact hooked up to--a piece \'s texture, and what you have is Bach for the 21st century --a Bach that Arts in Motion feels is necessary if classical music is to continue drawing crowds.  The people who are trying to evolve the classical music tradition always win,  says Haeker, who believes that if Bach were around today he \'d pounce on the new technology. Of course, this is mere irritant to some. There are purists, and they \'ve got a pretty good reason to be--Bach, after all, is Bach.  Bach moves. It \'s live. It \'s living,  proclaims Jonathan Sternberg, the festival \'s artistic director and conductor for the Festive Cantatas, scheduled March 24.  Everything is loud today, requires a microphone. But to hear a real soft sound that is beautifully created, the variation in dynamics is beautiful in itself.  The festival--one of the largest world music events in the country with origins in Chestnut Hill--is in its 31st year, and will be heightened this round in quantity and quality, promises executive director Guido Houben.  There \'s an interesting mix this time,  Houben says.  People are coming from Europe, from across the U.S. For the relative newcomer to Bach, Houben suggests visitors take in Sternberg \'s Festive Cantatas.  The concert that Jonathan is conducting--it features so many aspects of what Bach does. These cantata instrumentations are very changing, there \'s a lot of variety going on, a lot of wonderful melodies flowing into each other, a conversation. There \'s a number of colors, of different and varying compositions. And then, of course, you have the personality of Jonathan.  And what of this personality? Sternberg, an animated presence at 87, describes his conducting style as an individual interpretation.  I base mine on the experience and feelings I have,  he explains.  The musical score is like a road map--one point to another, either in a route by the mountains, a route by the lakes, the seaside--each gets you there.  Music, he asserts, is an aural sense, and his preference is that listeners close their eyes while absorbing the sound.  To appreciate Bach requires an effort--listening and adjusting, learning to know it.  For the  Bach expert,  Houben suggests attending a performance March 18, featuring German pianist Markus Pawlik who will perform Bach \'s Chromatic Fantasies.  He \'s giving it his own color, but then corresponding that with the Bach variations by Reger and a composition by Liszt. To put it in a nutshell, it \'s an afternoon of German composers and they all tackle Bach. What makes it distinct is the color. There \'s more tone to it, half steps--it will be very sophisticated in its harmonies.  Bach indeed is being tampered with. But perhaps a better word would be played. Bach indeed is being played--and played quite often--this March. For information, visit www.bach-fest.org. Caren Beilin lives in Philadelphia, PA.

SAVE THIS | EMAIL THIS | Close  Back-to-back Bach  It takes a 10-day festival to celebrate the great man \'s music and his 322d birthday.  By Robert Strauss  For The Inquirer  Simone Dinnerstein was not always the biggest fan of Johann Sebastian Bach. After all, the Brooklyn-based, Juilliard-schooled pianist was playing the works of composer Glenn Gould, and Bach was almost trite - three centuries past and hard to interpret in any new way. Then, Dinnerstein studied with Peter Serkin, who got her interested in Bach, and her whole idea of the German master mutated to the good.  His music, to me, is the ultimate combination of being incredibly well-crafted and mind-boggling in complexity,  said Dinnerstein.  He is very emotional and immediate. I am astonished at how much craft he used, but on the other hand, you don \'t need to know any of it to react. His music is extremely pure and about very basic and human feelings.  Dinnerstein will be playing Bach and Bach-inspired pieces Thursday, one of about two dozen performances by groups and individuals making up the 10-day Bach Festival of Philadelphia. The 322d anniversary of the composer \'s birth is Wednesday and will be observed within the festival.  The New York Collegium plays a program,  Mr. Bach Comes to Town,  tonight at the Church of the Holy Trinity. ª More photos  Bach, the premier organist of the 18th century, was one of the most prolific and influential composers of his time. He wrote more than 1,000 pieces of all sorts - cantatas, fugues, sonatas, concertos. He gained fame as an arranger, particularly of contemporary French and Italian composers like Vivaldi, whose work Bach then popularized in his native Germany. He was known as a teacher because of his technical excellence and, though music was shifting from his baroque style at the time of his death, Bach \'s legacy was enhanced because the next generation of grand composers - Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin, in particular - admired him so. Dinnerstein is among Bach \'s current admirers who do not find more than a week of celebrating Bach excessive.  Bach influenced music far beyond even classical. Maybe 10 days aren \'t even enough,  she said. Her concert on Thursday at the Trinity Center for Urban Life, 22d and Spruce, includes four preludes and fugues from Bach \'s Well-Tempered Clavier (Piano), two new Bach-inspired works by Philip Lasser and David Post, and Beethoven \'s Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor.  Everyone has a different idea of how to play Bach. In his keyboard music, there is no marking, no dynamics, no tempo markings of how quickly or slowly to play. There are just notes,  Dinnerstein said.  That opens up a lot of questions and gives performers a chance to use their imaginations. You can have the same piece played by many people and have it sound so different.  Guido Houben, the executive director of the Bach Festival, said that the 10 days of Bach not only offer different music and different interpretations, but also some instruments not often heard in Philadelphia. For instance, he said, some performers will use a baroque violin.  The strings are made of gut and not metal, which provides a lighter sound to begin with,  Houben said.  Then the bow is more rounded than the modern, flat one, so you can play four notes at once, get different kinds of arpeggios. It puts you back in the 1700s and 1800s with that crisper, lighter sound.  Dinnerstein, too, will be bringing with her a Fazioli piano, made by the Italian craftsman Paolo Fazioli, who makes only about 80 pianos every year.  It \'s almost like playing a sports car. The action is incredibly responsive and takes getting used to,  she said.  The result of all this is that you can get a variety of touch. The color of that sound I thought for this program would be interesting, because the contemporary pieces I am playing have lots of subtleties.   1 of 3  3/19/2007 11:31 PM    Back-to-back Bach | Inquirer | 03/16/2007  http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Back-to-b...  She said that Steinways, and other classic pianos, have richer sounds that Americans are used to, but her Fazioli will be a bit clearer, maybe even more brittle, but something new for an audience.  We \'ll have worship pieces, full orchestras, vocal pieces, modern interpretations, even dance and film. We \'ll be in Chestnut Hill, Center City, South Philadelphia and North Philadelphia,  said Houben.  This is what a festival should do. Not everything will be for everyone, but it is supposed to be entertaining, varied, educational, and accessible.

Chestnut Hill maestro, Jonathan Sternberg, led two programs that re-created those concerts conducted by the late Michael Korn, the festival \'s founder and guiding spirit, during that inaugural weekend in 1976. On hand to join him in the musicmaking were members of Korn \'s other musical creation, the Philadelphia Singers, some of whose choristers sang in those first events. Saturday evening \'s program of choral works by Johann Sebastian Bach brought back a flood of fond memories of Korn \'s peerless contribution to the region \'s classical music scene. When he founded the Philadelphia Singers in 1974, it was America \'s first allprofessional chorus. Two years later, the choir and the former Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia (now the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia led by Chestnut Hiller Ignat Solzhenitsyn) became the founding ensembles of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia.  A `TASTE \' OF HILLER \'S MUSIC: Chestnut Hill resident Jimi Odell, a jazz guitarist and vocalist who has played in Philadelphia area clubs for 37 years, will perform with a threeman rhythm section on Wednesday, October 18, 7 p.m., at Ogontz Grill, 7152 Ogontz Ave. in West Oak Lane, under the same management at Chestnut Grill. More info: call 215-248-1098.  Korn \'s interpretive approach to the choral music of the baroque and classical styles of the 18th century was revolutionary at the time.    Using pared down numbers and a more focused rather than broadly operatic tone, he was among the first choral directors in America to take up the cause of performing choral music of the 18th century more in the style appropriate to its aesthetic standards rather than in the fashion of the romantic era of the 19th and early 20th centuries. More attention was now being paid to counterpoint and theatrical coloring of the text. This movement had begun in Europe shortly after the close of World War II in 1945 and had garnered a powerful momentum by the 1960s. In America, however, the interpretive style had retained a distinctly Wagnerian scope until the 1970s when conductors like Korn began approaching baroque and classical choral music with a greater sensitivity to its own particular modes of expression. It was fascinating hearing Jonathan Sternberg lead works Korn, himself, had conducted three decades ago. The concert opened with the Motet:  Lobet den Hern, alle Heiden  and the Cantata No. 78:  Jesu, der mu meine Seele  before intermission, then concluded with the Cantata No. 147:  Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben.  At 87 years old and celebrating the 65th anniversary of his professional musical debut, Sternberg harks back to the style of interpreting 18th century music that pre-dated Korn \'s revolutionary approach. Tempi were broad and unhurried, phrasing was over-arching, and sections were rounded off with profound ritardandos. I would have preferred brisker tempi, lighter timbres for the sake of appreciating the counterpoint, and more rhythmic propulsion straight though to the final measure. And yet, Sternberg \'s approach had its pleasures and rewards. There was a glowing warmth to the music that was certainly preferable to the dry munchings one often hears these days, presented under the cover of  authenticity  when it \'s really little more than  unimaginative.  Along the way in all three scores, there was much fine singing from the choir and playing from the Bach Festival Orchestra. Flutist Mimi Stillman, oboists Tara Schauble and Priscilla Smith, and violinist Gloria Justen were particular instrumental standouts. Soprano Carole Latimer, altos Nancy Trauger and Jan Taylor, and tenor Kenneth Garner deserve special vocal credit. FANCY FREE    The Pennsylvania Ballet opened its 2006-07 season with a program of works by Jerome Robbins called Romance and Revelry. Performed before enthusiastic audiences in the Academy of Music, it featured  Fancy Free,   In the Night  and  The Concert.  More important, it offered some of the most thrilling dancing I \'ve ever seen from the company. Erdenheim \'s Roy Kaiser, the company \'s artistic director, spoke with pride recently when he pointed to the difficulty of scheduling an allRobbins program. The trust that oversees performances of the late choreographer \'s works is no less demanding than that which controls renditions of the ballets of the late George Balanchine. Robbins worked under Balanchine at the New York City Ballet and collaborated with such American musical icons as the late Leonard Bernstein. Kaiser noted the Pennsylvanians \' 42-year history of dancing Balanchine ballets as one of the reasons the Robbins Trust granted permission for the company to acquire  In the Night  for its repertoire. These performances marked the piece \'s premiere with the troupe and the first time it had ever programmed an all-Robbins roster. All the same, it was the well-loved  Fancy Free  that both opened the show and stole its audience \'s heart, in no small part due to the dancing of one of its leads. Of course,  Fancy Free  is as nearly a surefire hit as exists in the repertoire, what with its bouncy Bernstein score and exuberant choreography. And its tale of three sailors on the loose and on the prowl on leave in New York City is a natural winner. But without expert dancing, both technically and theatrically, even so guaranteed a triumph as  Fancy Free  risks falling flat. Not to worry whenever the Pennsylvania Ballet \'s Philip Colucci is cast as one of those three sailors. From a technical standpoint, he was flawless Sunday afternoon, especially his turns followed by splits. More telling still was his theatrical characterization of a young man bursting at the seams with macho energy to burn. James Ady and Jonathan Stiles were his combative cohorts in cavorting. THE MERRY WIDOW The Concert Operetta Theater of Philadelphia opened its 2006-07 season with a performance of The Merry Widow last weekend at the Academy of Vocal Arts \' Warden Theater in center city. The sentimental operetta was given a rendition so enjoyable that one can only hope for bigger and better things for and from this company.    In a city with far too few performances of opera and virtually none of operetta other than those of Gilbert & Sullivan, Concert Operetta Theater has carved out a regional niche for itself that needs and deserves support because no one else is doing what it does -- perform the glorious repertoire of operettas. With Daniel Pantano as its executive and artistic director and Nicholas Mastripolito as its music director, it \'s poised to take off to achieve greater triumphs if only it can garner some local support.

Chestnut Hill Maestro Jonathan Sternberg will conduct the Philadelphia Singers and the Bach Chestnut Hill maestro, Jonathan Festival Orchestra in Sternberg, in a pensive mood in concerts Saturday, October 2003. 14, at 8 p.m. and Sunday, October 15, at 4 p.m. in St. Paul \'s Episcopal Church, 22 E. Chestnut Hill Ave. in Chestnut Hill. The Philadelphia Singers, America \'s first all-professional choir, was founded by Korn in 1974 and was one of two local ensembles that formed the core of the Bach Festival. The other seminal ensemble of the Bach Festival was the Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia. That group has become the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia and is now directed by Chestnut Hill \'s Ignat Solzhenitsyn, who succeeded its founder, Marc Mostovoy. When Korn launched the Bach Festival, it was centered almost exclusively in Chestnut Hill and it presented virtually all of its concerts during the fall season of the year, making it a true festival in the European sense of the term, with a focused repertoire, location and schedule. Korn also made use of the region \'s own ensembles and soloists. He believed that Philadelphia \'s resident classical music community was among the world \'s most talented and reasoned that a    festival highlighting the music of Johann Sebastian Bach would give area musicians the opportunity to play and local audiences to hear them in performances of this peerless canon of masterpieces. When Korn relinquished the artistic reins of the festival after disagreements with portions of its board of directors, the organization moved from producing concerts to presenting them, hiring touring musicians to perform concerts for the festival. Programs were scheduled throughout the regular season, rather than only in October and November, and concerts were given all over the region, breaking the festival \'s distinctive link with Chestnut Hill. After years of nearly terminal decline, the Bach Festival has regained its artistic and geographic sense. The dynamic duo of artistic director Jonathan Sternberg and executive director Guido Houben reestablished its links with local musicians and returned many of the concerts to Chestnut Hill. The festival couldn \'t have chosen a more appropriate maestro to inspire and oversee its musical renaissance than Sternberg. His pedigree stretches all the way back more than six decades to studying with Serge Koussevitzky during the early years at Tanglewood and later with Pierre Monteux at his conducting institute in Maine. Sternberg embodies the  apostolic succession  that keeps the tradition of classical music alive in our own time even though parts of the repertoire hark back nearly a thousand years. His commitment to passing on the wealth of knowledge was manifested in his many years teaching and conducting at Temple University \'s Esther Boyer College of Music. Sternberg explained the choice of dates and repertoire as a replication of those first programs conducted by Michael Korn. For the concert on Saturday evening, the program will include the Motet No. 6 and the Cantatas Nos. 78 & 147. For the Sunday afternoon program, Sternberg will lead Bach \'s  Brandenburg  Concerto No. 3, Pachelbel \'s Canon in D, Vivaldi \'s Cello Concerto in G major with Charles Forbes as soloist, Handel \'s Organ Concerto in F major with Michael Stairs as soloist, and the Divertimento in D major by Mozart.  These are the exact programs Michael conducted,  Sternberg remarked,  and I feel that the Bach Festival -- which was really the Bach Festival of Chestnut Hill in the beginning! -- is hoping to rekindle the fire and the success of those early years.     Sternberg continued by saying that the festival \'s emphasis should always remain on the music of Bach and not succumb to the contemporary  celebrity syndrome  that focuses on the  star quality  of specific musicians rather than on the music, itself. He particularly noted the importance of introducing classical music in general and Bach \'s music in particular to young people so that they grow up knowing and loving it.  I remember hearing someone describing Bach \'s music as `always turning \' when I was a boy,  he recalled.  That \'s it, you know! Bach \'s music is always moving. It \'s not just a series of tunes. It \'s always moving ahead, and that \'s part of what gives you so much pleasure, either playing it or hearing it.  Bach \'s ability to express the spiritual meaning of the texts he employed in his choral music plays no less important a part in the stature and reverence with which Bach \'s music is held by musicians and audience members, alike.

Under the leadership of executive director Guido Houben and artistic and music director Jonathan Sternberg, the Bach Festival has rebounded and once again occupies a prominent place in Greater Philadelphia \'s classical music landscape. Michael Korn was the motivating force behind the founding of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia thirty years ago. As the founder and artistic director of the Philadelphia Singers (the first fully professional chorus in America) and the director of the Opera Company of Philadelphia Chorus, as well as a close collaborator with many of the other leading music directors in Philadelphia, Korn was in an ideal position to bring into being one of the region \'s most admired musical projects. Centering the Bach Festival almost exclusively in Chestnut Hill and performing most of its concerts in several of the lovely churches located in that section of the city, Korn modeled the Bach Festival of Philadelphia on those taking place in Europe. Over the span of two or three weekends each autumn, a series of concerts and recitals were given that often spanned a specific aspect of Johann Sebastian Bach \'s prodigious and inspired output. By involving other locally based ensembles such as the then-named Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia, led by their founder Marc Mostovoy, along with the Curtis Institute of Music and its cadre of incredibly talented young musicians, and calling upon the countless topnotch freelance players in Greater Philadelphia, Korn created a festival of Bach \'s music that achieved national and even international acclaim in a few short years. When differences of opinion regarding producing, presenting and/or promoting concerts arose between Korn and some members of the festival \'s board of directors, plus an increase in the budget deficit, Korn resigned as music director. Much like the decline of Spain following the defeat of the Armada in 1588, the deterioration of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia was immediate and profound. The bloom was off the lily and the lights were incrementally turned off. The festival \'s season shrank to a mere shadow of its former self, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and its spirit very nearly withered away and died. But much like the music of Bach itself--almost completely forgotten after his death in 1750 until Felix Mendelssohn rediscovered it after his appointment in Bach \'s town of Leipzig--the appreciation of that canon of masterpieces and the treasured memories of so many great performances of those scores were only hidden, not lost. It only demanded  Guido Houben, executive director of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia  12    something like Michael Korn \'s inimitable musicality and intense perseverance to stage a renaissance of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. In his youth, perhaps Jonathan Sternberg could have done it all by himself. Fortunately for the octogenarian Chestnut Hill maestro, his command over the music of Bach has been joined to Guido Houben \'s administrative expertise and energy. Houben was born in one of Germany \'s most historically prominent cities. Located in the southwest state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Trier is the oldest city in Germany that was formerly a fortress of the ancient Roman Empire. Its importance to the Romans is attested to by its possession of one of the holiest of Christian relics, the Seamless Robe worn by Jesus Christ. Discovered in the Holy Land by St. Helena, the mother of the first Christian Emperor, Constantine the Great, the robe was given a shrine in Trier early in the third century A.D. It is displayed every forty years as a mark of reverence. On a more profane note of notoriety, Trier was also the birthplace of Karl Marx. Houben \'s interest in music was immediate. His father gave him lessons on piano and organ and he studied liturgical music while a teenager. It should be remembered that Bach was the cantor for St. Thomas Evangelical Lutheran Church in Leipzig for the last decades of his life, composing more than three hundred cantatas for the Protestant liturgy as well as countless other religious scores. Houben eventually earned a master \'s degree in music composition as well as in the Russian language, and a doctorate in political science. He also studied at the Glinka Conservatory and the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut. For the four years following graduation, Houben worked in the office of a member of Germany \'s Federal Bundestag, akin to the United States House of Representatives. He focused on the financial activities of cultural groups, including music festivals and other treasured institutions throughout the country.  I was able to see how budgets were constructed,  Houben explained. In those days, the cultural budget of the Federal Republic of Germany was worth about  1 billion, plus an additional  50 billion spent by the individual state and local governments throughout the country. Houben found a far less generous governmental  Jonathan Sternberg conducting  environment when he came to work in America. But he didn \'t come unprepared. He studied administration at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, focusing his efforts on the workings of nonprofit organizations and their strategies for fundraising. Applying for and receiving a visa and legal status, Houben decided to remain in the United States. In 2004, he was offered the job of executive director of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. He accepted the post in July of that year, approximately four months after Jonathan Sternberg was hired as artistic director. He found an organization mostly unprepared for the coming season, lots of debt, virtually no money, and nearly no program. In little more than a month, Houben and Sternberg put together their first season. But they also set their sights on the 2005-06 season, which would begin the celebration of the Festival \'s thirtieth anniversary and the marking of the fifteenth anniversary of Michael Korn \'s death in August 1991.  It was its great past and traditions and my friendship with Jonathan Sternberg that attracted me to the Bach Festival,  Houben explained.  And Philadelphia has so much potential for a great Bach Festival. There are so many excellent musical ensembles. They all have supportive audiences. They \'re perfect for partnerships with the Bach Festival.  One of the most ambitious portions of the Bach Festival \'s 2005-06 season was its Festival Week in March of 2006. All the major orchestral works of Bach--the  Brandenburg  Concerti and the Orchestral Suites plus several solo and grosso concerti 13    --were performed in four concerts that took place in four different churches. The performers included two touring ensembles as well as the Philadelphia Bach Festival Orchestra. The series opened on March 17 when the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra played in the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church, making the first use of the sanctuary \'s newly reverberant acoustics. The following evening, Jonathan Sternberg led the Festival Orchestra at St. Rita of Cascia National Shrine Roman Catholic Church on Broad Street in South Philadelphia, pairing the church \'s Sicilian Baroque architecture with Bach \'s German Baroque music. Sternberg and the Festival Orchestra gave their second concert on March 25 in the Victorian Romanesque splendor of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity on Rittenhouse Square in Center City. The series concluded the following afternoon with the New York Chamber Soloists heard in St. Paul \'s Episcopal Church in Chestnut Hill. Other programs were presented in the Ethical Society on Rittenhouse Square, the Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill, Keneseth Israel synagogue  in Elkins Park, Chestnut Hill \'s Woodmere Art Museum, the Baptist Church of Chestnut Hill, and St. Peter \'s Episcopal Church in Society Hill.  Mr. Bach \'s Birthday Party  for children was held in Chestnut Hill \'s Episcopal Church of St. Martin-in-the-Field and an international vocal competition was held at the German Society of Pennsylvania. Looking into the future, Houben and Sternberg hope to present, produce, and promote a vast array of concerts, recitals, and activities on an even larger scale.  There are so many fine ensembles right here in Philadelphia,  he said,  and many are already performing programs of Bach \'s music and the music of other Baroque composers. You have Piffaro, Tempesta di Mare, Philomel, the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. There are also choruses such as the Philadelphia Singers, Mendelssohn Club, and Choral Arts Society, as well as those in local churches. There \'s the Cultural Alliance and the many educational institutions. It \'s my hope that the Bach Festival can bring them all together under one umbrella.  With the focus of the 2006-07 season of the Bach Festival on the master \'s choral works, both Jonathan Sternberg and Guido Houben are looking forward to audiences coming into Philadelphia from not just all around the region but from all across the country for two weekends and the evenings in between of the finest musicians playing the finest music.

But on Friday, whether to their pleasure or horror, they \'re about to find out. Messages Quisse by avant-garde lion Boulez whose complex, explosive music sends some classical audiences running for cover - will be heard alongside Led Zeppelin \'s  Kashmir,  thanks to Matt Haimovitz. The 35-year-old former child prodigy cellist has made it his mission to bring Bach and other great composers to small clubs - as opposed to concert halls with great orchestras, which is where Haimovitz \'s career began. But having survived his van \'s being towed by the Philadelphia police in past engagements, he \'s not only willing to face a club audience \'s reaction to Boulez, whatever it may be, but plans to encore the whole piece just to make sure everybody gets a fair chance with it. Here \'s what he \'s thinking:  We \'re doing it [the Boulez piece] in Montreal two days before. And after putting all this work into it, why not [in Philadelphia]? The whole middle section of the piece is extremely rock-and-roll, with driving, nonstop 16th notes. It \'s almost like jazz with jagged accents on the off beats.  You could argue that pop audiences are more conservative than classical, because that music is far simpler harmonically and is strictly Matt Haimovitz \'s mission is to bring Bach and other great composers to nontraditional venues. tonal.

There \'s no chip on his shoulder about concert halls; he \'s playing an evening of Bach cello suites at the Woodmere Art Museum on Saturday as part of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia. But Haimovitz \'s lack of conventional classical presence explains why the Bach Festival \'s press materials refer to him as an  Israeli cult artist.  There \'s truth to that (he was born in Israel, raised in the United States), particularly since he was one of the first major classical artists to seek complete artistic freedom producing his own recordings, starting with the Bach cello suites and recently with a disc of Hungarian composers titled Goulash!  Matt Haimovitz The 7:30 p.m. Friday concert featuring Boulez and Kodaly will be at World Cafe Live, 3025 Walnut St. Tickets:  28- 33. Information: 215-222-1400 or www.worldcafelive.com. The Bach Festival of Philadelphia concert will be at 7 p.m. Saturday at the Woodmere Art Museum, 9000 Germantown Ave. Tickets:  15. Information: 215-247-2224 or www.bach-fest.org.  But those who have followed Haimovitz for years know the strangeness implied by  cult artist  doesn \'t fit someone with his level of artistic dedication and personal amiability, not to mention the fact that he often drives himself on tours from Montreal, where he teaches at McGill University. Cape May audiences have heard him play the Dvorak Cello Concerto in recent years; he just toured with the Israeli Chamber Orchestra playing the Shostakovich Cello Concerto. With his decisive temperament and imposing tone, Haimovitz is perhaps a better choice for Shostakovich than some of the cellists who have played the piece at the Kimmel Center.  I have nothing against playing in a great sounding space where people really appreciate music. My problem with the concert hall has been some of the artificial traditions that have built up that have nothing to do with music itself - a lot of which originated in more informal settings,  he says. So his 2006 schedule also includes places such as Sam Bond \'s Garage in Eugene, Ore., and the Tractor Tavern in Seattle, though he \'s also playing the rarely heard Frank Bridge concerto, titled Oration, April 7 with the American Symphony Orchestra at Lincoln Center. Mostly, Haimovitz \'s presence in high-profile, conventional classical venues is with new music. He \'ll tour with a big band known as the Pittsburgh Collective and, in 2007, premiere a concerto for cello and DJ with MIT-based techno composer Tod Machover. You wonder if this is all because he grew up artistically allergic to the usual cello-piano chamber-music combination. Oddly, the more he pursues the alternatives, the more he gravitates back to Beethoven \'s cello-piano sonatas.  It \'s kind of funny,  he says,  that I \'ve gotten this bug all of the sudden.

Posted on Wed, Sep. 21, 2005  A pianist \'s Bach marathon  By David Patrick Stearns Inquirer Music Critic  Anytime you \'re settling in to hear a complete performance of Bach \'s six partitas - or, for that matter, Bach \'s complete anything - you can count on a fasten-your-seat-belt event in terms of length, rigor and adventure. That was especially the case in pianist Jeremy Denk \'s complete traversal of Bach \'s six partitas at Monday \'s opening of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Ethical Society. At times, he seemed to roar through the partitas as much as he played them. Denk \'s glistening, diamond-hard sonority, both penetrating and grand, his big gestures and electric-current tempos, assured that the three-hour evening would be the antithesis of what you \'d experience with a harpsichordist (who has more of a claim to this repertoire). Denk \'s grasp of the music \'s larger musical structures in these ambitious, hugely varied partitas - which so ingeniously incorporate dance and fugues and sometimes fuse the two - made a great case for hearing them all. However, Bach overload was a definite danger. As Denk summoned even more energy for the final piece, the dark, dense Partita No. 6 in E minor, you submitted as much as you listened. Some performance elements are bound to suffer in a long, one-composer evening. And though Denk seemed mentally present for every phrase, strong-mindedly sculpting each one with dramatic vitality, the quality of his decisions was uneven, ranging from the revelatory to the overbearing. The primary sacrificial element, however, was emotion. Often - though not always - he was guilty of skating over the surfaces. How much is that a problem? At present, Denk admirably presents the music with relative objectivity, as a gleaming musical edifice that you \'d want to probe and reprobe. Denk opened all the doors you could hope for, but let you decide to enter. The validity of the approach, though, can be fathomed only as it becomes more defined in the future. At present, Denk intriguingly defies established schools of Bach playing. He \'s the opposite of the pedal-heavy Andras Schiff school, though his temperamental forthrightness places him just as far from the minimum-pedal world of Glenn Gould. Intense as he is, Denk \'s playing is too controlled to be Russian. Figuring out what he \'s about creates a healthy, more deeply involving encounter with the music. In fact, the Bach Festival \'s other reputable but not so well-known guest artists promise a similar sense of discovery, one that I prefer to repeated encounters with the same, classical-music brand names.

Posted on Thu, Sep. 15, 2005  Pianist is making a bigger name for himself  By David Patrick Stearns Inquirer Music Critic  NEW YORK - Name Philadelphia \'s most often heard classical pianists, and one is far less famous than Andre Watts: Jeremy Denk. Beloved by hard-core audiences who attend smaller-scale recitals in museums and galleries, Denk has played in Philadelphia at least 20 times in the last 17 years. Three full Denk recitals are to come this season, starting with a rare, single-evening traversal of Bach \'s six partitas at the Bach Festival of Philadelphia \'s Monday opening. The other concerts, presented by his longtime champion, the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, will be Feb. 3 and May 17, with his customary recital partner, violinist Soovin Kim. Denk, 35, is still making important debuts, some as superstar violinist Joshua Bell \'s pianist of choice - which is how he arrived at Verizon Hall last spring. That \'s a switch from his first Philadelphia visit, a disastrous Curtis Institute of Music audition. Now, his association with Philadelphia borders on a love affair.  I have friends [there], so socially and musically, it \'s a great vacation from my life in New York,  he says.  I see the same people in the audience time after time after time. I feel like I have an audience family.  Denk is sitting cross-legged in New York \'s sunny Riverside Park, taking a break from his admittedly chaotic apartment. He gravitates toward a monument of Joan of Arc; they share an aptitude for doing the impossible. Just over the summer, Denk replaced Emanuel Ax in a Mostly Mozart Festival recital at Lincoln Center, and dusted off Tchaikovsky \'s Piano Concerto No. 1 for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra on one day \'s notice. Dusting off, for him, means memorization, right down to orchestration details. No wonder composers, who often miss deadlines, adore him. Denk thoroughly mastered Jake Heggie \'s concerto, Cut Time, inside of a month.  And he did it all with good humor and a warm and friendly collaborative way,  Heggie says.  Which is extremely rare.  Denk doesn \'t fathom his rareness:  If I \'m learning a concerto, wouldn \'t I want to know what the orchestra is doing?  The six Bach partitas are more than just making him sweat. When he came down with a high fever last week, he was told by one friend he was having Bach overdose. The concert offer arrived relatively late (April), and Denk saw the crush coming. But the partitas, which show Bach pushing the limits of possibility with unusual audacity, were irresistible. Besides, Denk has never regretted his risks.  Not yet,  he says.  Each one turned out nicely.  One reason for his success dangles from his key chain: a New York Sports Club membership card. Though never a jock, Denk knows how to cultivate stamina and says that some of the best practicing happens away from the keyboard.  Right now,  he says,  I can feel my brain going over passages of the partitas that I just played through. I never stay up all night practicing. I reserve my nights for more frivolous activities, like going out in the city with friends.  He also writes his blog, ironically titled  Think Denk: The glamorous life and thoughts of a concert pianist  (since it \'s not so glamorous), found at http://jeremdenk.blogspot.com. It \'s a travelogue of his charmed life with his share of dates (he \'s single), Proust and sake. So it \'s hard to imagine that the North Carolina-born, New Mexico-raised pianist was once, by his own description,  pretty nerdy, to be honest.  He was always on fast-track course schedules, which landed him in Oberlin College at age 16 with a double major: music and chemistry. But even his chemistry adviser told him to concentrate on piano, which he did at Indiana University under the esteemed Hungarian pianist Gyˆrgy Sebˆk. Denk did well in minor-league piano competitions in London and Munich, but even though he has always been technically commanding, he compares his younger self to a wild baseball pitcher:  Sometimes it would go amazingly, and sometimes it was all over the place.  His musical identity continues to form slowly. Only in recent years did he find a template for what has become a bracing, vigorous approach to Bach: After a chance encounter with the 1930s recordings of Swiss pianist Edwin Fischer, Denk had his godfather.  He captures the incredible sadness of the theme [of one of Bach \'s fugues],  Denk says, revealing where he \'s headed in his own Bach interpretations.  Fischer listens to the interplay of the voices. He doesn \'t explain it, but he listens to it. The flow is very natural. When another subject [melodic idea] enters, it \'s like a trumpet of the apocalypse. There \'s a thrilling tension; the last eight bars are devastating!  The gulf between envisioning and manifesting such insights remains the single problem of his existence.  I \'m obsessed with the saying that one \'s whole work is to shorten the distance between the brain and the fingertip,  he says.  I \'m an intense performer. I can get carried away. Sometimes, you \'d rather be watching from above the fray. That \'s what I \'m working on - being totally involved but in control in a bigger sense.

The weeklong event featured performances of Bach Masses in churches around town, concluding on Sunday with the composer \'s mighty Mass in B minor performed in the context of an Episcopalian service at the Philadelphia Cathedral. The overzealous use of incense, however, set off a high-tech fire alarm in the West Philadelphia church that wasn \'t silenced for 45 minutes - long after the Fire Department \'s arrival. Somewhere around the 20-minute mark, artistic director Jonathan Sternberg restarted the performance, amid piercing white emergency lights flashing throughout the church and a prerecorded voice repeatedly ordering an evacuation. Until then, it was hard to see how the evening was supposed to work. The idea of presenting Bach \'s Mass in a liturgical setting is initially intriguing, even though the composer didn \'t assemble the piece for that purpose. The Mass is such a huge, imposing religious experience unto itself that pairing it with a specific liturgical event is like trying to superimpose the blueprints of two cathedrals created for vastly different places and purposes. With performing forces sensibly scaled with 19 instrumentalists and 20 singers, Bach was presented in four blocks of music with a sermon, communion, readings and prayers in between - as well as stylistically clashing hymns by Ralph Vaughan Williams, sometimes with the church \'s organ wailing at a sonic magnitude that negated the Bach experience. Such distractions can be particularly destructive with music this challenging: Even if you \'re a veteran chorister, there are pages that put your heart in your mouth. In numerous pre-alarm moments, the Voces Novae et Antiquae wasn \'t up to it, even with the vocal soloists (including notables such as Julianne Baird, Christine Dunleavy and David Sharp) filling out their ranks. The sermon, delivered by the Rev. Joshua C. Aalan, explored the idea of saints as ordinary people who are inspired to do extraordinary things. His particular case in point was the German minister Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who tirelessly organized resistance to the Third Reich during World War II before dying in a concentration camp. So when the music resumed during the fire alarm, an accidental symbolism set in: The distilled genius and religiosity of Bach was pitted against an out-of-control world of relentless noise and corruption. Though the audience was previously scattered throughout the church, listeners clustered in the first several rows so as to hear better. In this competition of stimulus, Bach won - easily. Words can \'t say how moving it was, or how much more focused the performance became. But adversity shouldn \'t be needed to make the Bach Festival memorable. With veteran Bach conductor Sternberg newly installed as artistic director, programming is more authoritative, and Sternberg himself cuts an impressive figure on the podium. Yet so many easily fixable problems marred the performance (such as string intonation and choice of soloists), the Bach Festival has only reclaimed its territory tentatively.

It is a cause for celebration, to be sure, but in a very real sense, the festival has been reborn. It began life as a labor of love for the founder and then director of the Philadelphia Singers, Michael Korn. Korn was a masterful director of the great choral works of Bach and used his reputation to attract many superb musicians. Korn \'s tragic death in 1991 was a major loss to the Philadelphia music community and signaled a somnolent period for the Bach Festival, which contracted into a series of small, poorly marketed concerts and recitals in Chestnut Hill. Perhaps sensing an imminent demise, the festival \'s board of directors called upon the venerable conductor (and Philadelphia resident) Jonathan Sternberg to assume the post of artistic director in March last year. Guido Houben was also brought in as executive director. This turns out to be a fascinating and dynamic pairing. Houben, a German born and trained composer, has done post graduate work in nonprofit management, combining musical and marketing acumen in a way that has introduced notable vitality and imagination into the enterprise. Sternberg, an extremely well-connected eminence grise, is reinvigorating the Festival with diverse talent, including soprano Julianne Baird and pianist Charles Abramovic. He is himself a true pioneer in the field of contemporary baroque performance, as the conductor of some of the first recorded performances of Bach \'s cantatas in 1951. Sternberg might just as well be speaking about his new job when he declares that  baroque music has a new lease on life.  As an artist who has    seen Bach performance undergo a sea-change in scholarship and audience appreciation in a generation, he is quick to cut through the debates over how to play the music.  What bothers me is that we are living in a celebrity culture, and Bach is no longer the celebrity but the performers are.  He is sanguine on the subject of the authenticity of the instruments, a matter of tremendous interest among many younger performers.  We can play Bach perfectly fine on our new contraptions.  The festival has concerts planned for the whole season, which continues through June, but the coming days are a climax of activity with seven Bach programs in the offing. Four relatively unknown Lutheran masses will be performed as integral religious ceremonies at four Philadelphia churches, utilizing the exceptional musical faculties at the specific institutions. The culmination of that series will be two performances of a fifth mass, the mighty Mass in B Minor, one as a religious ceremony and one as a concert performance, both under the baton of Maestro Sternberg with the Bach Festival Orchestra and a trim vocal company supplied by the fine locally based Voces Novae et Antiquae. This magnificent work is a cornerstone of Western music, and Sternberg is far from alone when he sings its praises.  I discover new things in it every time I encounter it. It is one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written.  The Mass in B Minor, like all of Bach, gives the musicians very little concrete direction about performance practice.  There is absolutely no indication whatsoever about tempi and dynamics,  declares Sternberg. His inclination, hewing back to an earlier style of Bach playing, is to slower tempi than are currently fashionable.  I have a private recording of the music conducted by Georges Enescu [the great Romanian composer and musician] that is remarkable. It is slower than anything you hear today, and it makes the music sound much more religious.  Bach spent part of his career as a religious composer, but he also had a considerable stint as a court composer writing exclusively secular music. Two other concerts feature music from that second world, including a a recital by the extraordinary pianist Jeremy Denk that is a co-venture with the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society. There will also be a special concert centering around a single piece of music, the great  Chaconne  from the Partita for Solo Violin in D minor. This magical work has fascinated many composers through the ages, and it has received many interesting treatments, including piano versions by Brahms (for left hand alone) and Busoni, a piano and violin arrangement by Schumann, and a solo guitar edition by Segovia. All of those manifestations will appear on a recital Tuesday evening, beginning with the original as played by Philadelphia    Orchestra violinist Jason DePue. Later in the season, two other instrumental masterpieces are scheduled, The Art of the Fugue and Musical Offering. Sternberg vividly recalls the excitement that his early recordings of Bach generated among the music-loving public. Those efforts ignited a fire that still burns today.  The music is loved even more now.

Beethoven \'s Fifth, maybe. Perhaps something from Dylan or the Beatles. And on the shortest of lists, without a doubt, Bach \'s Toccata and Fugue in D minor, for organ. You \'ve heard it a million times, but there is nothing like the gut-wrenching impact of hearing this great lava flow of notes live on a major pipe instrument. The Bach Festival of Philadelphia welcomes the holiday music season with a recital of Bach and Liszt works, opening with that ubiquitous, but deathless, number. The program will also include Liszt \'s mighty homage to the genius Kantor of Leipzig, Prelude and Fugue on Bach. The soloist will be Martin Haselbˆck, the highly acclaimed former court organist of Vienna, who will perform on the Mander organ of the Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill. This instrument, which was installed in 2000, is significant because it is something of an anachronism, using mechanical, nondigital construction, with a sound that is ideal for this repertoire.

It has produced and presented many	landmark performances of Baroque music throughout the city (see info ). Of course the 30 th	anniversary season will celebrate this glorious past of Philadelphia culture	and excellence. And with your	support , the Bach Festival will again be able to offer a very special	season with the finest internationally renowned artists. Our monthly concert series	will showcase the complete Clavir Ubung (‚ÄúKeyboard Exercise‚Äù, including the	Goldberg variations, the Italian concerto, and the six partitas) as well as the	six cello suites and the six trio sonatas. The festival week near Bach‚Äôs birthday	on March 21 will feature the major orchestral works and a vocal competition. The 30 th anniversary	season is dedicated to the memory of Michael Korn. During the first 15 years	of the Bach Festival‚Äôs existence, he inspired all those who were surrounded	by his musical genius, even after he departed as artistic director in 1988.	In October 2006 we will commemorate the 15 th anniversary of his	untimely death in 1991 with a replica of the first ‚ÄúBasically Bach Festival‚Äù	weekend. If you would like to express your support, we invite you to place	your advertisement or salute in our Festival	program book and to make a	contribution for this very special part of our 30 th	anniversary season festivities. What started out as a weekend long	community event in the 1970‚Äôs developed into a concert series of several	weekends, then months. With this 30 th anniversary season, we are	expanding to a larger festival format again and are heading towards offering	you a 24/7 (full time) broadcast of Johann Sebastian Bach‚Äôs works on our	website. To integrate the season with the endeavors of all other music	organizations in Philadelphia, the Bach Festival has established the	‚Äú Bach 2 Phila Net Project ‚Äù.	This platform pools local resources to help better position Philadelphia	in the global Baroque music scene, integrate local communities,	and attract non-local artists and tourists. To keep the local past alive for	future generations, the Bach Festival also hopes to issue a CD set with	historic recordings of the past 30 years. This will include a comprehensive	booklet on its history and the one-hour television special produced by WHYY	TV-12 in 1985 which commemorated the 300 th birthday of both Bach	and Handel. Groundbreaking performances of local ensembles such as the B	Minor Mass with the Philadelphia Singers and Michael Korn shall be made	public for the first time ever. Your	contribution will help to realize this worthy project. We hope you will enjoy	participating in these projects and seize our 30 th anniversary	season promotion offers. Numerology is very important to Bach‚Äôs works and	therefore the Bach Festival of Philadelphia adds a bit to it: The	season pass subscription for 300 saves you over 30% of the ticket costs.	And finally, the phone and fax number, where you can reach us in Chestnut	Hill is (215) 247 BACH: For 2 x 15 years and now 24/7 we are BACH. I wish you a wonderful season with us and hope to meet	you soon at our concerts.

The competition continues a long Philadelphian	tradition, ranging from Leopold Stokowski‚Äôs transcriptions for the	Philadelphia Orchestra over Swarthmore graduate Peter Schickele‚Äôs ‚Äú PDQ	Bach ‚Äù to Bobby	McFerrin‚Äôs vocal Bach arrangements. The task is simply to present J.S.	Bach‚Äôs music in a new way. Thus, his music will stay meaningful in today‚Äôs	world and the participants bring Bach to the future. In the class till age 12, children are invited to use,	for example, a different instrument for their interpretation of Bach‚Äôs	music. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what instrument they choose‚Äîkazoo, ocarina, or	harmonica‚Äî as long as they play Bach well. It will give kids a chance to	become familiar with the composer,‚Äù says Maestro Jonathan Sternberg, the	Artistic Director of the Bach Festival. The winner receives a first prize of	1,000. For young artists 13 to 35, previous ‚Äúcreative assaults‚Äù	on Bach‚Äôs music such as jazz improvisations in a Baroque mode or	re-compositions of an existing Bach work √† la	Jacques Loussier , Swingle Singers ,	and the Modern Jazz Quartet aren‚Äôt the limit in a complex multimedia	world... They will have to come up with more than just a ‚Äúswitched-on Bach‚Äù.	The winner receives a first prize of 3,000. The jury consists of artists who have experimented with	Bach themselves, among them Jonathan Sternberg who conducted the first	performance of Stokowski‚Äôs Bach transcriptions in Europe in 1947;	Joel Spiegelman (Moscow/Princeton) who wrote the ‚Äú Goldberg	variations - a digital transcription ‚Äù in 1985; and Joel Lazar	(Washington, D.C.), musicologist and former conductor of Harvard‚Äôs Bach	Society Orchestra. ¬© The Bach Festival of Philadelphia, Inc. 8806 Germantown Ave Philadelphia, PA 19118 phone 215.247.BACH",33);arrFiles[213]=new Array(214,"welcome2004.aspx","2001-01-01","The Bach Festival of Philadelphia - Welcome to the 29th Season","Bach, Bachfest, Bach-fest, Bach-festival, Festival, Fest, Phila, Philly, Philadelphia, Sternberg, Houben, Sebastian, Johann, Music, Baroque, Period, Oregon, Bethlehem, Leipzig, Wolff, St. Thomas, Brandenburg, B minor, Passion, Future, Chestnut Hill, Cant","","Welcome to the 29 th Season By Jonathan Sternberg, Artistic Director The theme ‚ÄúBach to the Future‚Äù, which	we have chosen to parallel the Bach-Fest Leipzig, reflects the three	different focuses of our new season. So does the season‚Äôs graphic motif,	which you see on the left. Firstly, with a new team in Chestnut	Hill, the Bach Festival of Philadelphia itself is back on its way to	producing a year-long series of concerts as well as a world-class	festival, as it did in the past with international stars. From a	personal point of view, I find this very rewarding, as I am returning to	the early days of my own career with Bach and hope to convey to you the	‚ÄúBach to the Future‚Äù spirit that has comforted and excited me so often	in the past and which will guide us into the future. With this and your	generous support ,	the future of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia can indeed be bright. Secondly, we want to foster young	musicians and help them in the early stages of their careers. I myself was	very lucky when in 1951 as a young conductor I got the chance to record	Bach Cantatas for the	first time ever on LP . The Festival, therefore, has set up a number of concerts series , which bring Bach to the	future generation of musicians and audience members and offer young artists	from the area the opportunity to present their talents. Finally, the Festival intends to relate	Bach to the future ways of interpretation and to make the music meaningful	to today‚Äôs audiences. I remember well, shortly after the war, when I	premiered Leopold Stokowski‚Äôs transcriptions of Bach works in Vienna. This	was indeed very controversial in those tradition bound days. Since then,	Philadelphia has seen many creative interpretations of Bach‚Äôs music. We want	to continue this tradition, for example, with a series of all of his little	known masses integrated into church	services. In addition we want to inaugurate the ‚ÄúBach to the Future‚Äù competition . Thus,	we hope to give artists a chance to explore their ways of interpreting the	never-ending richness of Bach‚Äôs music. I invite, and urge you to enjoy the	wonderful music of Johann Sebastian Bach and hope to meet you at one of our	concerts.

Stay tuned... Female Bach: Did Anna Magdalena Bach Write the Six Cello Suites? From: The Telegraph, London By Barbie Dutter in Sydney and Roya Nikkhah (Filed: 23/04/2006) Famous works attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach were not penned by the great composer but by his second wife, researchers believe. A study by an academic who has spent more than 30 years looking at Bach \'s work claims that Anna Magdalena Bach, traditionally believed to be Bach \'s musical copyist, actually wrote some of his best-loved works, including his Six Cello Suites. Martin Jarvis, a professor at Charles Darwin University School of Music in Darwin and the conductor of the city \'s symphony orchestra, said that  a number of books would need to be rewritten  after presenting his findings to a Bach symposium last week. The findings have been described as  highly important  by Bach scholars and will be published in a doctorate, later this year. Prof Jarvis, who is originally from Wales, used police forensic science techniques to scrutinise manuscripts he believed to be written by Anna Magdalena. According to Prof Jarvis, Anna Magdalena appeared in the German composer \'s life earlier than widely believed, which was late in 1720 or in 1721. Prof Jarvis said he had found handwriting that showed she was in Bach \'s household in early 1720, and perhaps even as early as 1713.  This raised an interesting question,  he said.  What was Anna Magdalena doing in Bach \'s life when she wasn \'t supposed to be there?     I also discovered that the only complete manuscript from the time for the Cello Suites was a manuscript in the hand of Anna Magdalena, and that the original manuscript in the hand of Johann Sebastian had vanished.  Prof Jarvis claims that there is musical evidence to prove that the Cello Suites - whose exact date of composition has never been established - were not written by Bach. He points to what he regards as the uniquely symmetrical nature of the work, and to the fact that the manuscripts included many corrections and adjustments, suggesting that they were original composing scores.  When you examine Bach \'s other music there is no structural symmetry present in that sense,  he said. Prof Jarvis believes that Anna Magdalena also had a hand in composing the aria from the Goldberg Variations, and said it was highly likely that she composed the first prelude of the Well-tempered Klavier Book I. Yo Tomita, a Bach scholar based at Queen \'s University in Belfast, described the findings as  highly important . Stephen Rose, a lecturer in music at Royal Holloway, University of London, said:  It is plausible that she corrected, refined and revised many of his compositions, although there is not enough evidence to show that she single-handedly composed the Cello Suites.  Cellists who have performed the Suites extensively remained sceptical. Julian Lloyd Webber insisted that the compositions were  stylistically totally Bach  and that  many composers had appalling handwriting, which meant better copies would naturally have been made, with the originals then discarded . Steven Isserlis, the cellist, who is working on a recording of the Suites, said:  We can \'t say that it is definitely not true, in the same way that we can \'t prove that Anne Hathaway did not write some of Shakespeare \'s work, but I don \'t believe this to be a serious theory.     ",30);arrFiles[223]=new Array(224,"docs/ComeBach2006-06-30.pdf","2006-11-07","Come Bach 2006-06-30","","","Come Bach - eNewsletter of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia 6/30/2006  ∑ ∑ ∑  Jonathan Sternberg: 30th Anniversary Season Annual Report Available!

Annual Report: Big Stakeholder Value Increase The 29th season is history now. Its motto  Bach to the Future  has proven to be most characteristic for the season achievements - artistically, financially, and organizationally. After some difficult years, the stakeholder value has skyrocketed. As many of you experienced, the season topped expectations with a number of innovative products, first and foremost the premiere of JS Bach \'s five masses integrated in liturgical settings, including the mighty B Minor Mass at the Philadelphia Cathedral. As a result, in addition to our angels Chara & John C. Haas and the Leo Model Foundation, many previous supporters were once more engaged such as former presidents Martin Heckscher, Karl Spaeth, and Tony Carey. Maestro Sternberg \'s vision also attracted new supporters like Gerry Lenfest and Raymond Perelman.

Eric Fung made his orchestral debut in Lincoln Center in 2000 and	performed Johannes Brahms‚Äôs Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor under the	baton of Maestro Otto-Werner Mueller.	The subsequent review for his concerto performance in the New York	Times, described his playing as ‚Äúremarkably mature‚Ä¶ his pianism striking	for its refinement and elegance.‚Äù In 2003 Eric was engaged by the Hong	Kong Arts Festival to perform two piano recitals.

The following May, he	made his piano recital debut at the Carnegie Hall performing Bach‚Äôs Goldberg	Variations and Beethoven‚Äôs Eroica Variations. The New York Concert Review	(summer 2004) described the Goldberg Variation as follows: ‚ÄúVibrant rhythmic vitality, a welcome flexibility of	nuance, phrase shapings and when necessary a requisite lyricism.

This is a misconception that we have outgrown today, but it seriously troubled 19 th -century musicians. Even to composers as gifted as Mendelssohn and Schumann, who deserve much of the credit for their century‚Äôs rediscovery of Bach, the set of three sonatas and three partitas he had written around 1720 while he was Kapellmeister at C√∂then constituted a puzzle. Regarding the sustained passages of unaccompanied melody as something abnormal, they consequently tried their hands at providing accompaniments for them. After this evening‚Äôs opening performance of the Partita No. 2 in D Minor, the rest of our program offers a rare opportunity to hear the celebrated Chaconne‚Äìthe last movement of that work‚Äìin a variety of modified versions. There is never only one way to perform a musical masterpiece, and the viewpoints of the distinguished composers whose thoughts about the Chaconne we shall thus encounter are sure to deepen our understanding of what it was that made the original great in the first place. If the additional textures grafted onto the Chaconne by a Mendelssohn and a Schumann must be regarded as luxuries, enjoyable in themselves but in no way implying that the music lacked viability without them, the reason may seem paradoxical: it has to do with the fact that Bach was a great contrapuntist. What, it might be asked, has this to do with music that is written for much of its length in only one part? But the paradox is only superficial. One of the principal faculties that entitle a composer to be regarded as a great contrapuntist is the ability to write vital and interesting basses: and one of the principal features of Bach‚Äôs unaccompanied violin melodies is that they are their own basses. What Bach achieved was the solution of a problem whose very existence Mendelssohn and Schumann, from their viewpoint at a quite different stage in music history, were unaware of. Bach‚Äôs first biographer, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, who lived from 1749 to 1818, was close enough to his subject to see more clearly, and he realized that the art of these works was the art of writing in one part so that the addition of any other parts is unnecessary. The partitas and sonatas What really lies behind Bach‚Äôs writing is a whole polyphonic tradition rooted in the choral masterpieces of the 16th century‚Äìof Lassus, and of Palestrina and his school. These in turn have their origin, on the liturgical side, in the ancient system of Gregorian tones and, on the secular side, in the medieval manifestations of European folk-music. The polyphonic choral influence is most obvious in the fugal second movements of the sonatas, but it is certainly not limited to these movements, and it can be felt beneath the surface also in the partitas. For practical purposes, ‚Äúpartita‚Äù means much the same thing as ‚Äúsuite.‚Äù Whereas the sonata, in the course of time, grew more and more dramatic, drawing on the dynamic potential of tonal contrast and conflict, a certain essentially static, architectural quality remained the distinguishing mark of the suite or partita from first to last. Contrast here depends entirely on the different types of dance rhythms used, and with few exceptions partitas were written with all their movements based in the same key. The layout might vary greatly from one instance to another, but the essential dance movements of the classical suite form are four: allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue. Bach‚Äôs D-Minor Partita follows this traditional scheme as far as the gigue, but then breaks radically with precedent by ending with a chaconne of gigantic proportions and power. This is the only partita of the three, incidentally, in which Bach uses Italian spellings for the titles of all the dances; but the smoother Italian style nevertheless predominates over the jerkier French manner almost throughout the set. The Chaconne: Bach-Mendelssohn, Bach-Schumann, Bach-Brahms, Bach-Busoni... It was on 11 March 1829, just a few weeks after his 20th birthday, and almost exactly 100 years after the St. Matthew Passion had been heard for the first time, that Felix Mendelssohn conducted, in Berlin, the first performance of that great work since the composer‚Äôs death. The event marked the beginning of the huge revival of interest in Bach, and of the reevaluation of his music that has continued ever since. Some years later Mendelssohn composed a piano accompaniments for the Preludio of the Partita No. 3 in E Major, and in 1847, the year of his own death, the accompaniment for the Chaconne that we hear this evening was written. Five years after that, Robert Schumann began work on a more extensive project that he later referred to as his ‚ÄúBachiana‚Äù: this began with writing piano accompaniments for the six partitas and sonatas for violin, and went on to encompass also the six suites for solo cello. Those two projects involved not arrangement as such but the addition of new material to Bach‚Äôs scores. The keyboard versions by Johannes Brahms (for left hand only) and Ferruccio Busoni are indeed arrangements. Brahms‚Äôs version, actually titled a ‚Äústudy,‚Äù was made in about 1877. Brahms is much more willing than his colleagues to leave the original violin line in its pristine monodic state, without adding anything to Bach‚Äôs text, so that for much of its length it could well be termed not an arrangement but literally, in the narrow sense of the difference between the two words, a transcription. Not so the Busoni. Through much of his life, which was spent largely in Berlin, this fascinatingly individual Italian composer-pianist made arrangement of many Bach works. His version of the Chaconne, made around 1897, is at the opposite extreme from straight transcription. In it Busoni instead translates the characteristic effects Bach drew from the violin into the completely different language of the modern piano, producing what has been described as ‚Äúa magnificent amplification that preserves the meaning of the masterpiece, articulates what is implicit and, in responding to one challenge, presents yet another.‚Äù These are by no means the only transformations that the glory of the Chaconne has spurred later musicians into essaying. There are arrangements for, among other more or less likely combinations, piano trio, vocal quintet, trombone quartet, trumpet and orchestra, and just orchestra. Andr√©s Segovia‚Äôs popular arrangement for guitar naturally, given the nature of the instrument, makes of the Chaconne a rather gentler, more intimate piece than do any of those. It is even listed on a CD web site as part of a collection offering ‚Äúthe most relaxing guitar music in the universe.‚Äù Well, one can only wonder what Bach‚Äôs reaction to that would have been.
